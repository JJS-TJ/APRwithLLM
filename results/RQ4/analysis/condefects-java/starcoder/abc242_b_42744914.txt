// Analysis

Now, the code is working as desired. However, the code still has a bug. The code is supposed to print a new line after printing the sorted string, but currently, the code prints the new line at the very end of the code. 

To fix this issue, you need to print the new line before printing the sorted string. 

Correct Code:

}

Analysis:

Now, the code should sort the entire string and print the sorted string on the output. However, the output doesn't contain the sorted version of the input. 

To fix the issue, you need to add a space before the printing and then remove it.

Correct Code:

	Scanner sc = new Scanner(

	out.flush();
}

Analysis:

This code is supposed to read a string, sort it and output the sorted string. However, there are two issues:

1. The output string doesn't contain the sorted version of the input string.

2. The sorting is done only by the first character of the string and not the whole string. Hence, the output string doesn't contain the sorted version of the input string.

// Analysis
Analysis:

This code solves the problem in a simple way. It first sorts the input string by using the sort function of the Arrays class. The sorted string is then converted into a character array and then into a string. This string is then printed as the output.
