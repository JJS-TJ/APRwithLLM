No.1 Patch
public static void main(String[] args) {
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  int n = sc.nextInt(), s = sc.nextInt(), k = sc.nextInt(), total = 0;
  for(int i=0; i<n; i++) total += sc.nextInt() * sc.nextInt();
  System.out.print(total >= s ? total : total + k);
}

// Analysis
// Analysis:
This function is the same as the buggy function, with the exception of one line.
The line says, "The total is greater than or equal to s, then print out the total.
Otherwise, print out the total plus k."

Possible Bugs:
1. If n is zero, the program will try to read integers from the Scanner without having any.
