// Analysis
The fixed function solves the buggy function. It has the same basic structure as the buggy function. However, the buggy function updates the variable "ans" by adding
the square root of N to the sum instead of adding the square root of N to ans.

The code has one more improvement: The variable "ans" is of type long, which can hold a value up to 2^63 -1
