// Conclusion
The code has been improved by replacing the modulo operation by an equivalent operation that can work even when the value is negative. This operation is not used anywhere else in the program.

As a result, the program no longer throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when the number of people is less than the number of spoon directions, nor when the number of people is 0.

The code has also been improved by removing unnecessary modulo operations in the for loops.

As a result, the program no longer throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when the number of people is greater than the number of spoon directions.

The code has also been improved by replacing the division operation by an equivalent operation that can work even when the value is negative. This operation is not used anywhere else in the program.
