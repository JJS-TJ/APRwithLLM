}

// Analysis
This code fixes the bug in the original swapping function.

The problem with the function is that it swaps the characters at index a and b, but it swaps them backwards. The first character at index a is swapped with the second character at index b, but the second character at index b is swapped with the first character at index a. The correct order is to swap the characters at index a and b.

This code is a solution.

// Analysis
Analysis:
The problem is to swap the characters at index a and index b of the input string. However, the swapping operation contains a bug: arr[b - 1] = tmp; should be arr[b - 1] = tmp;. 

The corrected code should look like this:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    // Your code here
    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

### 5. Reverse (String)

Problem:
You have a string, and you want to reverse it. You can perform this operation using a temporary variable, or by modifying the characters in place. However, you canâ€™t use additional data structures.

Input Format:

A single string.

Output Format:

Print the string, reversed.

Sample Input:

abcde
Sample Output:

edcba

Solution:
```java
