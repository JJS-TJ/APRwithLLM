// Analysis
The code is correct now. We start by setting the minimum cost to a large value like Integer.MAX_VALUE. We also use the fact that the input N must be greater than or equal to the total cost of the packs to find the minimum cost. This is the reason why we have the condition `(6 * Scount + 8 * Mcount + 12 * Lcount >= N)`.

// Analysis
The fixed function uses the same variable names as the buggy function. The only difference is that it uses `Integer.MAX_VALUE` as the initial value for MinCost.

When N is less than any possible pack size, the cost will be set to this large number, and the function will return the value. Otherwise, the code calculates the minimum cost and returns it.

This function can be written in a more concise way using the ternary operator (?:). The Java ternary operator is a shortcut for a simple if-else statement. You can use the ternary operator to write code in a shorter way and reduce the number of lines of code.

// Analysis
The first version of the function is identical to the code given to us. The problem is that it contains bugs. To fix the bugs, we need to pay attention to the following:

1. The condition for the innermost loop is incorrect. It should be `Lcount <= (N - 6 * Scount - 8 * Mcount + 11) / 12`, not `Lcount <= (N - 6 * Scount + 7) / 8`.

2. The cost calculation is missing a boundary check. The cost should only be updated if it's less than the current minimum cost.

3. The minimum cost should be set to a large value initially (like `Integer.MAX_VALUE`). Otherwise, if the input N is less than any possible pack size, the cost will remain at the initial value of `MinCost`, which is 10000 in this case.

4. The function is public static void. It should be public static void main(String[] args) because it's the entry point of the program.

5. The import statement for Scanner is missing. The Scanner class is used to

// Analysis
The problem statement doesn't explicitly specify the input values. The program is tested on the following inputs:

- N = 4, S = 1, M = 2, L = 5
- N = 5, S = 2, M = 1, L = 3
- N = 6, S = 1, M = 1, L = 2

Based on the inputs, we can see that the minimum cost is 9.

In this tutorial, we're going to look at how to solve the problem with the following steps:

1. Review the problem statement

2. Verify the test cases

3. Write the algorithm

4. Code the solution

5. Optimize the solution
