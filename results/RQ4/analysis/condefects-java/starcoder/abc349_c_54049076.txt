// Analysis
Fixing the bug:
The corrected code looks more or less like the original one. The problem was that the third element of the array T was not checked in the if statement. It should have been T[2].toLowerCase(), instead of T[2].equals("X"). The buggy code is now fixed, so the function should now be correct.

However, in the corrected function, the variable "b" is never set to true, so it will always print "No" when the input contains t with more than two characters.

The third element of T should be checked in order to find the next character in t, after the current two elements have already been checked. This will prevent the program from printing "No" when t has more than two characters, but it will still print "No" when the third character is not part of the string.

The corrected function could look like this:

// Corrected Function
