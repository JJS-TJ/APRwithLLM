// Analysis
The fixed code is very similar to the buggy code. The main difference is that the Scanner object and the PrintWriter object are closed after they are no longer needed.

There are still some improvements that can be made in this code.

1. The code contains a long multiplication for every single number, even though only the first three and the last three numbers are used. This can lead to unnecessary calculations and potential performance issues.

2. The code uses the % operator for division, which is not the standard modulo operator. This could lead to incorrect results in cases where the result is negative.

To fix these issues, the code should be modified as follows:

1. Remove the long multiplication for every single number.

2. Use the Math.floorMod function instead of the % operator for division.
