// Problems
// Problems
The program contains a bug that will not allow it to handle user input correctly. If the user input does not include a space after the string "Friday", the program will not print anything. This problem can be fixed by simply removing the space after the string "Friday" in the program.

This problem also requires the program to compare the user input to a list of days of the week, rather than a list of integers.

If the user input does not match any of the days of the week, the program should print "Error: no such day".

Otherwise, the program should print "Error: unexpected input" to indicate that the

// Result

No output will appear for any user input (e.g., "Friderick", "Mondays", etc.). However, if the user input includes a space after "Friday", the program will print the corresponding number (e.g., "Friday ", "Fri", etc.).

Note that this fix can be made in other ways (e.g., by changing the user input to "Friday" or by replacing the space after "Friday" with an empty string), and the bug will still occur. This shows that the bug exists, but does not explain why.

The program now correctly prints the corresponding number for days of the week, regardless of whether the user input includes a space.

This is the recommended fix for this bug:

- Remove the space after "Friday"
- Correct the spelling of "Thursday" to "Thursday"

To make the fix:

case "Thursday":
	System.out.println("2");

// Analysis

The main function of the program seems to take user input and compare it to days of the week. If the user input matches a day of the week (ignoring case), the function will print a corresponding number.

However, there is a bug in the program. The last case, "Friday", does not have a space after "Friday". This will not match user input that includes a space, causing the function to not print anything for that input.

To fix the bug, simply add a space after "Friday":

case "Friday":
	System.out.println("1");
	break;

Your task is to take the user's input and determine whether it is a palindrome.

The first method is to use an array of characters to store the user's input. Then, the method will use a for loop to iterate through the user input array and compare the characters of the input to the characters at the end of the array. For example, if the user's input is "tacocat", then the method will check if the first character of the input is the same as the last character of the input. If the first character does not match the last character, the method will print "This is not a palindrome".

Another method is to

Wednesday: 3
Thursday: 2
Friday: 1
