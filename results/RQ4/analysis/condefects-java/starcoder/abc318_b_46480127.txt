// Analysis
Analysis:
This code is supposed to calculate the total number of unique squares that are covered by the given rectangles. The coordinates of the rectangles are given as input.

Errors:
1. The main method is not static. It should be static for the entry point of a Java program.
2. The condition in the nested for loops that fill the g array with true is incorrect. It should be a comparison (==) instead of an assignment (=). 
3. In the second nested for loop, the condition to increment the ans variable is incorrect. The condition should be g[i][j] == true instead of g[i][j] = true. 

Corrections:
1. Change the main method to static.
2. Change the condition in the nested for loops that fill the g array with true from g[i][j] = true to g[i][j] = true.
3. Change the condition to increment the ans variable from g[i][j] = true to g[i][j] == true.
4. Include a Scanner import statement at the top of the file.
