Analysis:
The corrected code runs in linear time and constant space. The first loop in the corrected function maps each character in the input string to its replacement. This loop is run once, so the time complexity of this loop is O(N), and N is the length of the string. Since the size of the change array is 26, this means that the time complexity of this loop is O(26*N), which simplifies to O(N).

In the second loop, the replacements are applied to the input string. This loop runs at most N times, so the time complexity of this loop is O(N), which simplifies to O(N).

Since the time complexity of the first loop is O(N) and the time complexity of the second loop is O(N), the total time complexity of the corrected function is O(N).

Since the change array is of size 26
