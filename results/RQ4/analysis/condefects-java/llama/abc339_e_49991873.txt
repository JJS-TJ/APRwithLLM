// Analysis
Analysis: 
The code is trying to update a binary indexed tree (also known as a Fenwick tree) with the given value at the index x.

The function has a few issues:

1) The inner loop will never execute because i > lowbit(x) is always false due to the way the loop is set up. This means that the loop is effectively skipped, which is not the expected behavior.

2) The update operation is incorrect. The line tree[x] = value is rewriting the value at x, but this should be a max operation updating the
