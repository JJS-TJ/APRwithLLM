// Analysis
// Analysis
The main function of the program seems to take user input and compare it to days of the week. If the user input matches a day of the week (ignoring case), the function will print a corresponding number.

However, there is a bug in the program. The last case, "Friday", has a space after "Friday". This will not match user input that does not include a space, causing the function to not print anything for that input.

To fix the bug, simply remove the space after "Friday":

case "Friday":
	System.out.println("1");
	break;

This change will ensure that the program correctly prints the corresponding number for days of the week, regardless of whether the user input includes a space.

// Analysis
// Analysis
The bug has been fixed in the program by removing the space after "Friday". This ensures that the program correctly prints the corresponding number for days of the week, regardless of whether the user input includes a space.

The main function of the program is still intact. It takes user input and compares it to days of the week (ignoring case). If the user input matches a day of the week, the function will print a corresponding number.

Overall, this code is a simple yet effective solution for the buggy function. By fixing the bug, the program can now correctly handle all possible user inputs, making it more reliable and useful for its intended purpose.
