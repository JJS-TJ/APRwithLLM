// Analysis
//Analysis:

The function 'solve' is supposed to take an array of integers and two integers x and y as input and return the number of sub-arrays in the array that contain both x and y, and no other elements between them.

To fix the issues in the original code, we have taken the following steps:

1. The variable 'ans' is declared as a long, which is a 64-bit integer type. This allows it to store larger values than an integer, and avoid any overflow issues.

2. We have added a check to ensure that x and y are not present in the array. If either x or y is not in the array, we return 0.

3. We have added a check to ensure that x and y are not the same. If x and y are the same, we return 0.

4. We have added a check to ensure that y is not larger
