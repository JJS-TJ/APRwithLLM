// Analysis:

1. The function is written in the main method of a class.

2. The import statement for java.util.Scanner is missing.

3. The code uses Scanner to get input but Scanner is never closed which is a resource leak. 

4. The code is only checking if the sum of diagonal elements is less than the sum of non-diagonal elements and not if the elements are less. It should be "if(ar2[i][j]+ar2[i-1][j-1]<=ar2[i][j-1]+ar2[i-1][j])".

5. The inner loop should start from 0 and end at w.

6. It doesn't handle the case when the matrix dimensions are less than 2.

7. There are no comments in the code which makes it difficult to understand what the code is doing.

8. The code should be inside a class to avoid compilation error.
