// Analysis
The code reads four integers from input and then it iterates through the integers from 0 to 99. If the current integer i is between L1 and R1 and also between L2 and R2, it increments the variable ans. At the end, if ans is greater than 0, it decrements ans by 1. Finally, it prints the value of ans.

Bug: The code does not handle the situation when L1 > L2. In such a case, the interval of integers between L2 and R2 may overlap with the interval of integers between L1 and R1. But this overlap is not accounted for in the code, which can

// Analysis
The code now ensures that the intervals do not overlap by checking if L1 is less than L2, in which case it handles the situation where the interval of integers between L2 and R2 overlaps with the interval of integers between L1 and R1. It does this by subtracting L2 from L1 and adding 1 to the result. Similarly, it checks if L2 is less than L1 and handles the situation where the
