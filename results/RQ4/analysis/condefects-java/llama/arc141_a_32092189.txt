// Analysis
1. The function main() is static, and it is the entry point of the program. It starts by taking an integer input 't', which determines the number of test cases.

2. Then it enters a loop 'for' that runs 't' times. In each iteration, it takes a long integer input 'n'.

3. The function tries to find the largest number that can be formed by repeating a substring of 'n'. It does this by iterating over possible lengths of the substring in a loop 'for'.

4. Inside the loop 'for', it checks if the length of 'n' is divisible by the current length. If it is, it repeats the substring that many times and checks if the resulting number is less than 'n'. If it is, it reduces the substring by 1 and repeats the substring the same number of times. The resulting number is then compared with the previous largest number found.

5. If the number of repetitions for the current substring length results in a larger number, it is stored as the new largest number.

6. If the number of repetitions for the current substring length results in a number greater than 'n', the loop 'for' is broken and the function moves on to the next iteration of the loop 'for'.

7. After the loop 'for', the function checks if the number formed by repeating the first digit of 'n' for 'n' times is larger than 'l'. If it is, it is stored as the new largest number.

8. Finally, it prints the largest number found.

9. The function repeats steps 2-8 for 't' test cases.
