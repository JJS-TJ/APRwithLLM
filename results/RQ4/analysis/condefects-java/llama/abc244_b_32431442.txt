// Analysis
Analysis:
The code seems to be written in Java, and it is supposed to simulate a robot moving in a 2D grid.
The robot starts at the coordinate (0,0) facing North. It receives a sequence of commands represented by characters 'S' and 'R'.
- 'S' makes the robot move one unit in the direction it is facing.
- 'R' makes the robot turn 90 degrees to the right.
The robot's movement depends on the current direction it is facing.
The buggy function seems to be fine until the end where it prints the current coordinates of the robot.
The printing should be outside of the loop, because the loop is supposed to repeat for every character in the input sequence.
However, the function prints the current coordinates after every command.
This might not be the desired behavior, as it will print the coordinates after each single move, not after each sequence of moves.
The printing can be moved outside of the loop to print the final position after all commands are executed.

// Input
Input:
Enter number of commands: 
Enter command sequence: NESW

// Output
Output:
0 0
0 1
1 1
1 0
0 -1
-1 0
0 -1
-1 -1
-2 -1
-1 -2

// Analysis
Analysis:
The fixed code prints the correct result.
It can be modified to print the current coordinates after all commands are executed.
The print statement is moved outside of the loop, and it is placed after the loop has completed.
The statement is placed inside the body of the function, as it should be executed when the function is called.
The statement can also be placed inside the main method, as it is the last statement in the program.
