// Analysis
The buggy function is trying to calculate the minimum cost to buy N donuts. The donuts are sold in packs of 6, 8, and 12. The cost of the packs is given by S, M, and L respectively.

There are some bugs in the code.

1. The condition for the innermost loop is incorrect. It should be `Lcount <= (N - 6 * Scount - 8 * Mcount + 11) / 12`, not `Lcount <= (N - 6 * Scount + 7) / 8`.

2. The cost calculation is missing a boundary check. The cost should only be updated if it's less than the current minimum cost.

3. The minimum cost should be set to a large value initially (like `Integer.MAX_VALUE`). Otherwise, if the input N is less than any possible pack size, the cost will remain at the initial value of `MinCost`, which is 10000 in this case.

4. The function is public static void. It should be public static void main(String[] args) because it's the entry point of the program.

5. The import statement for Scanner is missing. The Scanner class is used
