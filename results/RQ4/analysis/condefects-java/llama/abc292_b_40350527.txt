// Analysis
In the Fixed Function, the logic of the if else conditions is modified to correctly handle all possible values of query1.
When query1 is 1, it means that the status of the item in the array at the index of query2 should be set to 1.
When query1 is 2, it means that the status of the item in the array at the index of query2 should be set to 2.
When query1 is anything other than 1 or 2, it should be treated as an instruction to print the status of the item in the array at the index of query2.
The check `circumstance[query2-1] >= 2` is used to print "Yes" or "No". This ensures that the correct output is produced even if the value of circumstance[query2-1] is not exactly 2.

The code is modified to correctly handle all possible values of query1 and to produce the correct output.

// Analysis
Bug Description:
In the Buggy Function, there is an issue with the logic of the if else conditions. The condition `query1 == 1 || query1 == 2` is incorrectly used.
It is set to consider only the values 1 or 2 for query1. However, it is unclear what should happen when query1 equals any other value. 
The code will skip this value and it will not produce any output. Therefore, it is not clear what should be done in this case.

The code should be modified to correctly handle all possible values of query1. 

If the value of query1 is 1, it means that the status of the item in the array at the index of query2 should be set to 1.
If the value of query1 is 2, it means that the status of the item in the array at the index of query2 should be set to 2.
If the value of query1 is anything other than 1 or 2, it should be treated as an instruction to print the status of the item in the array at the index of query2.
