// Analysis
Analysis:
The fixed function reads two integers from the user input using a Scanner object. The function then enters a while loop, which continues until x is less than y. Inside the loop, it increments x by 10 and increments a counter (cnt) each iteration. The loop then exits when x becomes greater than or equal to y.

The expected output of the function is the value of c
