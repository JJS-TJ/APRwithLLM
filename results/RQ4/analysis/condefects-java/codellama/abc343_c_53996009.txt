// Analysis
The main function reads a long number from the user and then calculates the largest perfect cube that is also a palindrome.
It does this by looping through all cubes less than or equal to the input number, and checks if each cube is a palindrome using the check function.
If a cube is a palindrome, it is stored as the largest found palindromic cube.
The check function receives a string and checks if it is a palindrome by comparing the characters in the string from both ends.

The bug in this code is in the main function. In the for loop,
