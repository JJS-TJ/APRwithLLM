// Analysis

The bug is now fixed by the fix function.

The function starts by initializing a variable "ans" to 0. Then, a for loop starts with a variable "y" that ranges from 1 to the square root of N.

Inside the loop, a variable "zNum" is calculated as N divided by y minus y. 

In each iteration, the function updates "ans" by
