// Analysis
You should analyze the code from time complexity and potential bugs.

Time Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of the function is O(QN) where Q is the number of queries and N is the number of elements in the queue. This is because, for each query, we are potentially iterating over all the elements in the queue.

Bug Analysis:
1. Java convention: The main function should be declared as "public static void main(String[] args)" and should not have any return type.
2. Data type mismatch: The variable N is expected to be an integer but it is declared as a string.
3. Duplicate entries: The queue is a set and does not allow duplicate entries. However, in the code, multiple instances of the same number are being added to the queue.
4. Invalid removal: The remove method of HashSet does not throw an exception if the specified element does not exist in the set. Thus, there
