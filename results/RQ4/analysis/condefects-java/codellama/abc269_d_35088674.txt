// Analysis
The fixed version is now correct. The first two lines have been swapped, and the second two lines have been moved to the beginning of the function.

The first line checks if the coordinates are valid and if there is an obstacle at the cell. If any of these conditions are not met, it will return immediately.

Then, the function will check if the cell has been visited or not. If not, it will return immediately. Finally, it will continue with the DFS.


// Buggy Function
private int[] getStartPoint() {
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            if (!vis[i][j] && occ[i][j]) {
                return new int[] { i
