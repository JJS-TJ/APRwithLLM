// 1. H, W, and A should be initialized as static variables.
// 2. H and W should be initialized before the for loop that fills the A array.
// 3. A should be initialized to an array of size H+1 x W+1 to match the expected size based on the input.
// 4. The list.get(k)== list.get(k+1) inside a loop, should be replaced by list.get(k).equals(list.get(k+1)) to handle the case when the elements are of different types.
// 5. The code should be modified to handle exceptions that could occur when reading from the Scanner, like InputMismatchException or NoSuchElementException.
// 6. The code should be fixed to match the expected output by removing the extra closing brace.

// Analysis
// This code has been fixed to resolve the initial issues. However, it could still have some issues in the area of functional correctness.
//
// 1. There are multiple issues that could cause the code to behave incorrectly, such as:
//
// 	a. The code might throw an exception if the user enters invalid input, such as a non-numeric value.
// 	b. The code might not be able to handle all possible inputs, such as very large H and W values.
// 	c. The code does not handle the case when there are multiple possible paths with the same number of holes.
// 	d. The code does not handle the case when there are no possible paths.
// 	e. The code does not handle the case when there are multiple valid paths.
// 2. There are multiple logical issues in the code, such as:
//
// 	a. The count variable is calculated incorrectly, as
