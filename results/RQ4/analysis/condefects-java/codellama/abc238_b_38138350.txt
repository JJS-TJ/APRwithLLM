// Analysis
The fixed solve method in this code is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum angle between two cuts on a circle.

The bug has been fixed. The print statement is now inside the loop and is executed at each iteration of the loop, giving the correct maximum angle between two cuts on a circle.

The fixed code would look like this:
<|EOT|>

// Final Output
The following is the final output of this code:

input
