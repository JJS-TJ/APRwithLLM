// Analysis
Analysis:

As in the buggy function, the fixed function reads two integers from the user input using a Scanner object. The function then enters a while loop, which continues until the value of x is less than y. Inside the loop, it increments x by 10 and increments a counter (cnt) each iteration. The loop then exits when x is greater than or equal to y.
