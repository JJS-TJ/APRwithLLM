// Fixed Code Analysis
The code reads four integers from input and then it iterates through the integers from 0 to 99. If the current integer i is between L1 and R1 and also between L2 and R2, it increments the variable ans. At the end, if ans is greater than 0, it decrements ans by 1. Finally, it prints the value of ans.

Bug: The code does not handle the situation when L1 > L2. In such a case, the interval of integers between L2 and R2 may overlap with the interval of integers between L1 and R1. But this overlap is not accounted for in the
