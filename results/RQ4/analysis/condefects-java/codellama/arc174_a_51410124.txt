// Analysis
Analysis:
The provided code is supposed to solve a problem related to the Maximum Sum Array problem. This problem asks to find the maximum sum of a subarray in an array considering both positive and negative numbers.

The buggy function seems to have a mistake in its logic and doesn't produce the correct output for certain test cases.

Here are the issues:
1. Incorrect array initialization: The line `int a[] = Arrays.stream(new int[n]).map(e -> sc.nextInt()).toArray();` is not necessary as it initializes an array of size 'n' with zeroes and then maps a function to each element which is unnecessary. It would be better to use `int a[] = new int[n];`.

2. The condition for finding the maximum value in `dpMin` is incorrect. In the provided code, it checks if `min <= 0` which will always be true if `c > 0`. The correct condition should be `min < 0` as we want to find the minimum negative number to subtract from the sum.

3. The loop for calculating `dpMax` and `dpMin` is incorrect. It should be `dpMax[i] = Math.max(dpMax[i - 1] + a[i], a[i - 1]);` and `dpMin[i] = Math.min(dpMin[i - 1] + a[i], a[i - 1]);`.

4. The calculation of result is incorrect. In the provided code, it multiplies `c - 1` with `max` and `min` which is incorrect as `c` should be greater than or equal to 1. The correct calculation should be `result = sum + c * max` and `result = sum + c * min` respectively.

5. The print statement `
