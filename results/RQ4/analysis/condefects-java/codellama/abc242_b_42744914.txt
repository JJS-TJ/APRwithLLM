// Analysis
Analysis:

This code is supposed to read a string, sort it and output the sorted string. However, there are two issues:

1. The sorting is done only by the first character of the string and not the whole string. Hence, the output string doesn't contain the sorted version of the input string.

2. The output string doesn't contain the sorted version of the input string.

To fix these

}

// Analysis
Analysis:

The code is now fixed.

The string is now sorted and printed out.

Note that the string is sorted using the sort method on the array. This method is declared in the Arrays class, and takes the array of characters as a parameter.

The sorted string is printed using the print method of the PrintWriter class. The print method prints a single string and prints a newline character.

Arrays.

// Analysis
Analysis:

This code sorts the whole string and outputs it. Hence, the sorted version of the input string is displayed in the output string.

Time Complexity: O(n^2), where 'n' is the number of characters in the string.

In the worst case, the function sorts the string with all the characters different from each other. Hence, it will take O(n^2) time to sort the string

}

// Analysis
This code has fixed the issues. However, there is a small issue: the output string contains the sorted version of the input string, but it also contains some other characters in the beginning. This is because we use a `char[]` to store the string, rather than a `String`. Hence, the `char[]` stores the string in the form of the ASCII values and hence, you see the characters in the beginning of the output. You can fix

// Analysis
Analysis:

After fixing the bug, the function works as expected. However, there is still a bit of code that is redundant. You can remove the redundant code:

Correct Code:

public static void main(String[] args) {
	Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);
	
	String s =  sc.next();
