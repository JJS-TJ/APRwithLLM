// Fixed Function Analysis
Fixed Function Analysis:
The fixed function is a method, which is a more structured approach to programming.
It is easier to debug and maintain compared to the buggy function, and it does have documentation.
It has input validation to check if the input is a valid integer.
It does not have any memory leaks or potential vulnerabilities.
