public static void main(String args[]){

    //Using booleans when dealing with yes/no, true/false, 1/0.. , minimising no of variables
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int N = sc.nextInt();
    int orgPrice = sc.nextInt();
    int discPrice = sc.nextInt();
    int minDPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    int[] dishesPrice = new int[N];
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
        dishesPrice[i] = sc.nextInt();
        if(dishesPrice[i] < minDPrice) minDPrice = dishesPrice[i];
    }

    System.out.println(Math.min(orgPrice, minDPrice + discPrice));
}

In this fixed function, the loop starts from 0 and the minimum dish price is initialized to Integer.MAX_VALUE so that any dish price is less than it. 
The System.out.println line prints the minimum of the original price and the sum of the minimum dish price and the discounted price.

This function now correctly finds the minimum dish price, and correctly calculates the price to pay based on the original price, the discounted price, and the minimum dish price.
