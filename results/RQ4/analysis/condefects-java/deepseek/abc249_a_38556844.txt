// Analysis
// Analysis:

In the fixed function, `rest` is a counter that increments with each loop iteration. It is used to track the progress of the rest interval. If `rest` is less than `a`, `b` is added to `ans`, and `rest` is incremented. If `rest` is equal to or greater than `a`, it resets to 0. This is the basis of the rest intervals and the sum of `b` values.

This function should now correctly calculate the sum of `b` values at regular intervals `a` and `c`.
