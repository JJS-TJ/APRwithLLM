The bug in the original code was that it did not check if the room opened by the keys was the same as the previous keys. This resulted in false positives, and the code would print 0 even if there were no conflicts. The fixed code checks if the room opened by the current keys is different from the previous keys, and if it is, it prints 0 and exits.

In conclusion, the original code has a bug where it did not check if the room opened by the keys was the same as the previous keys, resulting in false positives. The fixed code checks if the room opened by the current keys is different from the previous keys, and if it is, it prints 0 and exits.
