In the corrected code, I replaced the ideographic space (which is represented in Unicode as `\u3000`) with a regular space character, which is represented as `" "`. This makes the code work as expected.

To ensure that this doesn't happen in the future, it's recommended to use a text editor or an IDE that has features for automatically detecting and correcting encoding issues, such as replacing characters with their standard equivalents

In this corrected code, the ideographic space is replaced by a regular space character (" "). This ensures that the output is properly formatted with spaces between the characters.
