// Analysis
In the fixed code, the bug is fixed by correcting the loop condition. Instead of checking if "y" is less than or equal to the square root of N, it should check if "y" squared is less than or equal to N. 
This ensures that all possible divisors of N are included in the computation.
The rest of the function remains the same, with the addition of the square root of N to the final answer. The
