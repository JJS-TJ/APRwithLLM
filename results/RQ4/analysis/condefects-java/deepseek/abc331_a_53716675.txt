public static void main(String[]args){
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  int month = sc.nextInt();
  int day = sc.nextInt();
  int y = sc.nextInt();
  int newMonth = sc.nextInt();
  int newDay = sc.nextInt();
  
  if(day == newDay){
    if(month == newMonth){
      System.out.println((y + 1) + " " + "1 " + "1");
    }else{
      System.out.println(y +" " + (newMonth + 1) +" " + "1" );
    }
  }else{
      System.out.println(y + " " + newMonth + " " + (newDay + 1));
  }
}

// Analysis
This corrected code now correctly calculates the new month and day based on the current month and day. However, it still has the same issues as the original code. It does not handle leap years, it does not validate the user input, and it does not have any comments.

Remember to wrap the Scanner code in a try-catch block for potential InputMismatchException or NoSuchElementException. Also, always validate the user input to ensure it is within the valid range. And always add comments to your code to make it easier to understand.
