No.2 Patch
public static void main(String[] args) {
  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
  int A = sc.nextInt();
  int B = sc.nextInt();

  if (B - A == 1 && A % 3 != 0) {
    System.out.println("Yes");
  } else {
    System.out.println("No");
  }
}
```
With the corrected code, if the difference between A and B is 1 and A is not divisible by 3, it will print "Yes". Otherwise, it will print "No".
