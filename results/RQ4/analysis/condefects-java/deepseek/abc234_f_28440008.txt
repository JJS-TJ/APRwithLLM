// Analysis
In the fixed function, we first handle the base cases where r > n and n = r or r = 0, and return 0 in the former case and 1 in the latter.

Next, if the result is already calculated and stored in map[n][r], we return it directly instead of recalculating it. 

Then, we calculate the result using the formula for combinations, and store it in map[n][r] before returning it. 

This function is now efficient as it avoid
