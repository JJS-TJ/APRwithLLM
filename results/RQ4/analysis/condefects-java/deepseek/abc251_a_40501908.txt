// Analysis
The above code is fixing the bug where the output was not displaying the entire resultant string but only the last input string.
The bug was because instead of printing the resultant string res, the input string p was being printed.

// Analysis

This problem occurs because the buggy function is appending the input string to the res StringBuilder until its length is 6, and then it prints the original input string. The fixed function appends the input string to the res StringBuilder until

// Analysis

// In the provided buggy function, we are not considering the case when the length of String p is not a factor of 6.

// Analysis
The fixed function is much cleaner and also gives the output that we want, the string p is appended in res until its length is 6 and then res is printed.

// The buggy function prints the input string "p" instead of the resultant string "res" while printing the output. Hence we need to print res.toString() instead of p.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>package com.company;

//  The buggy function is printing the string p and not the string res.
