			circumstance[query2-1] = circumstance[query2-1] + query1;
		} else {
			if (circumstance[query2-1] >= 2) {

// Analysis
The Fixed Function corrects the Buggy Function by properly handling all possible values of query1.

If query1 is 1 or 2, the status of the item in the array at the index of query2 is updated accordingly.

If query1 is not 1 or 2, it is treated as an instruction to print the status of the item in the array at the index of query2. Here, the condition is changed to `circumstance[query2-1] >= 2`, which ensures that the status of the item in the array at the index of query2 is at least 2 to print "Yes".

This modification ensures the correct and expected output of the function.
