In this corrected function, the code properly reads the input number, checks each digit against the previous digit, and prints "Yes" if all digits are in increasing order, or "No" otherwise.

With the above code, the function will correctly check if the digits of the number are in increasing order.

In the fixed function, the previous digit is initially set to the least significant digit of the input number, then the number is divided by 10 to get rid of that digit. The while loop then continues, setting prev to the current digit and dividing the number by 10, checking if the current digit is less than or equal to the previous digit. If it is, the function prints "No" and ends. If no such pair of digits is found, the function prints "Yes".

In this corrected code, we first divide the number by 10 and assign the remainder to prev. We then enter a while loop that continues as long as n is greater than 0. In each iteration, we divide n by 10 and assign the remainder to number. If number is less than or equal to prev, we print "No" and return from the function. If not, we assign number to prev and divide n by 10. If we exit the loop without finding a number less than or equal to the previous

In the corrected code, we save the least significant digit to prev and then divide n by 10 to remove the least significant digit. This process is repeated in the while loop until n is 0. The program then prints "Yes" if every digit is greater than the previous one, and "No" otherwise. 

Now the function works as expected. 

Remember to always test your code to make sure it works as expected. You can do this by using different test cases and comparing the output to what you expect. This
