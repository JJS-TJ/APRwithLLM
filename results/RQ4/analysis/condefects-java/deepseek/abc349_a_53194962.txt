public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) { // corrected loop condition
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        sum += a;
    }
    System.out.println(0 - sum);
    sc.close();
}

Explanation: The loop condition was corrected from i < 0 to i < n. This change ensures that all n numbers are included in the sum.

The loop runs from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) to correctly calculate the sum of the first n - 1 numbers.

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int n = sc.nextInt();
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        sum += a;
    }
    System.out.println(0 - sum);
    sc.close();
}

Explanation: The bug in the original code is that it does not subtract the sum of the first n - 1 numbers from 0, but instead adds them. To correct this, we should subtract the sum from 0.

The corrected code now calculates the sum of n - 1 integers and then subtracts this sum from 0.
