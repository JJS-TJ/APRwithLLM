// Analysis of the fixed function
1. We have imported the Scanner class.

2. We are getting input from the user and storing it in the variable K.

3. We are calculating the hour by adding K/60 to 21 and taking modulo 24 because the starting time is 21:00 and we want the hour to be in the range of 0-23.

4. We are calculating the minute by taking modulo 60 of K because a day has 24*60 minutes and we want the minute to be in the range of 0-59.

5. We are formatting the output string with
