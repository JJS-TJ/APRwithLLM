// gcd is a function to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers

// Explanation
// The bug was in the calculation of p, which was the product of a and b, and should be the product of a and b divided by their greatest common divisor.
// This is because the numbers that are multiples of both a and b (i.e., those that are multiples of a*b) are counted twice in sum1 and sum2, and should be subtracted once when we subtract sum3.

// The function gcd is used to find the greatest common divisor of a and b. This is the number that divides

// Explanation
// The original function was not correctly calculating the sum of multiples of 'a' and 'b' less than 'n' when 'a' and 'b' are not coprime. This was because it was not taking the least common multiple (LCM) of 'a' and 'b' to calculate the sum of multiples of 'a*b'.
// The function was fixed by using the formula for sum of multiples 'p' less than 'n' which is (p*((n/p)*((n/p) +1))/2) for non coprime 'a' and 'b' we use (a*
