No.1 Patch
public static int F(int X) {
    return X*X+2*X+3;
}

This function now correctly uses the addition operator to perform the mathematical operations.
 // In this code, a bug was found
No.2 Patch
public static int F(int X) {
    return X*X+2*X+3;
}

In the corrected function, the bitwise XOR operator is replaced by the multiplication (*) operator. This corrects the
No.3 Patch
public static int F(int X) {
    return X*X+2*X+3;
}

// Analysis
Analysis:

The fix involves changing the bitwise XOR operator (^) to the multiplication (*
No.4 Patch
public static int F(int X) {
    return X*X+2*X+3;
}

// Analysis
Analysis:

The corrected function has the return statement corrected to use the multiplication operator (*) instead of
No.5 Patch
public static int F(int X) {
    return X*X + 2*X + 3;
}

// Analysis
Analysis:

The fixed function now uses the multiplication (*) operator for squaring X and the addition
No.6 Patch
public static int F(int X) {
    return X*X+2*X+3;
}

// Explanation
Explanation:

The correct function should use the multiplication (*) operator instead of the
No.7 Patch

// Analysis
Analysis:

The corrected function corrects the logical error by replacing the bitwise XOR operator (
No.8 Patch
public static int F(int X) {
    return X*X+2*X+3;
