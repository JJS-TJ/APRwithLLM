// Analysis:

In the corrected code, the function now correctly takes the number of people and their arrival order into account. It also takes in a number of queries, and for each query, it correctly identifies the person who arrived first in the queue based on their arrival order. The people are numbered starting from 1, so we subtract 1 from the query inputs to convert them to array indices, and add 1 to the result to convert them back to the original person numbers.

// Explanation
Explanation:

The fixed code creates an array 'order' to store the order of people's arrival. It then takes each person's number and stores it in the order array at the index person-1. The index is person-1 because the person numbers start from 1, but array indices start from 0.

The program then takes a number of queries (qnum). For each query, it takes two person numbers (query1 and query2) and compares the order of their arrival. It then prints the person number who arrived first. The person numbers are decremented by 1 because the person numbers start from 1, but
