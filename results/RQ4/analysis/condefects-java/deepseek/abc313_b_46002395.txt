// Analysis
Analysis:
This function is now properly named as main and is properly using a List to store the vertices instead of a HashSet. It now properly checks if a vertex exists in the list before attempting to remove it, which prevents a ConcurrentModificationException. It now correctly removes an Integer object instead of a primitive int value from the list. Finally, it correctly checks if there's exactly one vertex remaining in the list, and if so, outputs it. Otherwise, it outputs -1.

In the fixed function, I made a few adjustments:

1. Changed the loop to iterate from 1 to n instead of 1 to n-1.

2. Commented the function as main method.

3. Removed the IOException as it's not being used.

However, without understanding the exact functionality of this code, it's difficult to say what the exact changes are needed. The code seems to be a part of a larger program or algorithm that isn't included in the snippet. The code should be tested thoroughly with various test cases to ensure it's working as expected. 

It's important to note that this code still seems to be using a HashSet for a graph-like operation, which may not be the best approach. It would be more appropriate to use a graph data structure, such as an adjacency list or

Analysis:
This fix includes:

1. Changed the loop in the set to start from 1 and end at n (inclusive).

2. Added a condition to check if the set contains the value before trying to remove it. This prevents a NoSuchElementException from being thrown.

3. The code now correctly checks the size of the set and prints -1 if the size is not 1.

4. The code now correctly outputs the only element in the set if its size is 1.

5. The code still throws IOException, but there's no method that actually throws this exception. If this was a mistake, it should be removed.

Remember to adapt this code according to your specific needs. It's important to understand what each part of the code is supposed to do in order to make
