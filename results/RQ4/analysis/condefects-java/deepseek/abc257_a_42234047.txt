public static void main(String[] args){
       Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
       int c = sc.nextInt();
       int n = sc.nextInt();
       String a = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
       int index = (int) Math.floor(n / c);
       if(n % c == 0){
           System.out.println(a.charAt(index - 1) + "");
       }else {
           System.out.println(a.charAt(index) + "");
       }
}


This code will ensure that the index is always an integer, which will be a valid index for the string a. It also correctly handles the case where n is not divisible by c, by using the Math.floor function to round down to the nearest integer.

Remember that the index of the string starts at 0, not 1, so when you subtract 1 from the index in the first case, you are accessing the correct character.
