# Analysis
Analysis:
The function has been fixed to calculate the number of ways to pick n numbers from the binary representation of a number m such that the numbers in the picked set are greater than the numbers in the rest of the set.

Specifically, the function has been fixed to calculate the number of ways to select n numbers from the binary representation of m. The code has been updated to populate an array dp with the count of ways to select n numbers from the binary representation of m.

The code has been updated to calculate the count of ways to select n numbers from the binary representation of m by only summing up the count of ways to select n numbers from the binary representation of m where k is greater than j.

# Analysis
Analysis:
This function is the same as the buggy function, except that it has been modified to implement the correct solution.

Specifically, the implementation has been modified such that dp[i+1][k] only updates when k>j.

Furthermore, the modulo operation has been moved after each addition operation to prevent overflow.

Lastly, the modulo value has been changed from 988244353 to 998244353.

# Analysis
Analysis:
The fixed function is written in Python. It is designed to calculate the number of ways to pick n numbers from the binary representation of a number m such that the numbers in the picked set are greater than the numbers in the rest of the set. The function correctly calculates the number of ways to select n numbers from the binary representation of m.

Specifically, the function appears to calculate the number of ways to select n numbers from the binary representation of m. The code seems to be attempting to populate an array dp with the count of ways to select n numbers from the binary representation of m.

The bug is likely in the implementation of the for loop that iterates over the range of j and k. Here, it's trying to sum up the count of ways to select n numbers from the binary representation of m, where j and k are indices into the binary representation of m. 

However, the code is attempting to sum the count
