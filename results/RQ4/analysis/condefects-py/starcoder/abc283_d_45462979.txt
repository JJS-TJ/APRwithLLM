# Analysis
The fixed function is pretty much the same as the buggy function except for the two places where the bug was in the buggy function.

The buggy function adds the characters to the set `t` and the list `a[-1]`. But it only checks if the character is already in `t` in the `else` clause. It should also check if the character is already in `a[-1]` because it adds the character to `t` and `a[-1]` before checking if the character is already in `t`.

The buggy function does not remove the characters from the set `t` in the `for` loop

# Analysis
1. The buggy function seems to be trying to check if a string has duplicate alphabets that are in a pair of brackets. The function is supposed to print "No" if it finds duplicate alphabets within the same pair of brackets and "Yes" otherwise.

But there are several bugs in the function:

1. The condition in the if statement `if i.isalpha() == True:` is redundant because `i.isalpha()` already returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`). So, it should be just `if i.isalpha():`.

2. In the else clause, `t.add(

Analysis:
The fixed function is almost similar to the buggy function except for a couple of issues:

1. It checks if the character is already in `t` in the else clause, `if i in t:` instead of `if i == True:` as the buggy function does.

2. It checks if the character is already in the list `a[-1]` in the for loop `for j in a[-1]:`, `if j in a[-1]:` instead of `if j == True:` as the buggy function does.

3. It adds the character to the list `a

  #  print(t)
  #  print(a)

print("Yes")

Analysis:
The fixed function has the following changes:

1. The condition in the if statement `if i.isalpha() == True:` is not redundant anymore. The function checks if `i` is an alphabet.

2. In the else clause, `t.add(i)` adds the character to the set `t` and `a[-1]`.

3. The else clause checks if the character is already in `t`. If it is already in `t`, it prints "No" and exits.

4. The for loop `for j in a[-1]:` removes the characters from `t`.

# Analysis
The above fixed function now works fine. The function first checks if the character `i` is an alphabet. If it is, it checks if the character is already in the set `t`. If the character is already in `t`, it prints "No" and exits. Otherwise, it adds the character to `t` and `a[-1]`.

If the character `i` is a closing bracket, it checks if `a` is an empty list or not. If it is, it does nothing. If it is not, it removes the characters from `a[-1]` from `t`.

If the character `i` is an
