# Analysis
print(check(N,D))

Analysis:

The fixed code is a python code which involves two functions check and main function.
The check function is buggy and it does not work properly.

1. The function check is supposed to check if every person is available from the date b to the date c. 
But it is not doing that correctly. It is checking if any person is unavailable in the given date range.

2. The check function is called in the main function. The main function is looping over all possible date ranges and checking if everyone is available in that range. If yes, it updates the answer.

3. The check function is returning True even if the person is unavailable in the given date range.

4. There is no error handling in the code. If the input is not in the expected format, it will throw an error.

5. There is no comment in the code. This makes it hard to understand what the code is doing.

6. There is no function to append the input string to the a list.

7. There is no function to return the value of ans.

8. There is no function to print the value of ans.

9. There is no function to print the value of x.

10. There is no function to print the value of a.

11. There is no function to print the value of i.

12. There is no function to print the value of j.

13. There is no function to print the value of N.
