# Analysis
// Analysis
This code is supposed to calculate the minimum number of breaks needed to fix all broken wall panels.

This code has the following changes from the buggy code:

1. The wall list is sorted based on the second element of each sublist, which is the start position of each wall panel. This is the correct sorting criteria.

2. The code is using a list data structure instead of a deque data structure to store the wall panels.

# Analysis
This code fixes the bugs in the previous code.

# Summary
* Use deque for data structures when you need to pop left/right from both ends of the list.
* Check if a wall panel overlaps with the current wall panel.
* Keep updating the value of now after a break.
