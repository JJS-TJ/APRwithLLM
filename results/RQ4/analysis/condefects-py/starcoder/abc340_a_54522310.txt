# Analysis
Analysis:
Now the while loop is checked for the condition 'A+D<=B' before appending the value of 'A

# Analysis
Analysis:
This code is supposed to generate an arithmetic progression starting from 'A', with a common difference 'D' and ending at 'B'. However, there is a logical error
No.6 Patch
A,B,D=map(int,input().split())
ans=[A]
while A<B:
  ans.append(A+D)
  A+=D
print(*ans)

# Analysis
Analysis:
This is the corrected version of the above code, where we have added the condition 'A<B' to the while loop.

In this way, we are able
