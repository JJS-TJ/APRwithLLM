# Analysis
Analysis:

Now that we have fixed this bug, we should now be able to get the intended output.

# Fixed Function
n = int(input())
for i in range(n+1):
  for j in range(n
No.4 Patch
n = int(input())
for i in range(n+1):
  for j in range(n+1):
    for k in range(n+1):
      if i + j + k <= n:
        print(i,j,k)

Analysis
This is the same as the code above but with a fixed loop range of n+1 instead of n.

# Challenge
The challenge is to write a function that prints all combinations of n numbers where the sum of the n numbers is less than or equal
