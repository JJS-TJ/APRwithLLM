# Analysis
Analysis:
The fixed function is the same as the buggy function but the issues listed above have been fixed.

Issues:
1. The code is taking the number of inputs to be converted in a string as input but is not using this input.
2. The code is taking a string as input but is not using this input for the conversion.
3. The loop range should be from 0 to len(S). Right now, it is from len(S)-1 to -1 which means it is iterating from the
