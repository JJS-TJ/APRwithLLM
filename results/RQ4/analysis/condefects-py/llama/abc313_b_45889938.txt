#最強の人を求めればいいだけなので、誰かに負けたかどうかを調べる
#負けたことがない人が複数人いたら最強は絞れない
N,M=list(map(int,input().split()))
player=[i for i in range(1,N+1)]
losers=[]
for i in range(M):
    a,b=list(map(int,input().split()))
    losers.append(b)

strongest_player=[p for p in player if p not in losers]
if len(strongest_player)==1:
    print(strongest_player[0])
else:
    print(-1)

# Analysis
This code has the same bug as the previous code, but it has also been fixed. The code checks if the player exists in the list `losers` before attempting to remove it from the list `player`. This ensures that the code does not try to remove an element from the list that does not exist. Additionally, the code now handles the case where multiple players have not lost any game by printing -1.

else:
    print(-1)

# Analysis
This code has been corrected to handle the case where multiple players have not lost any game. In this case, the code should print -1 because it is not possible to determine the strongest player in such a case.
