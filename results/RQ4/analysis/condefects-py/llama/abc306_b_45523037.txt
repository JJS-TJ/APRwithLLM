a = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0
for i in range(len(a)):
    ans += 2 ** i * a[i]
print(ans)

# Analysis
The fixed function works by first reading the input as a list of integers and then converting it to a list of binary digits. Then, it loops through each binary digit and adds the corresponding power of 2 to the answer. Finally, it prints the answer, which is the decimal equivalent of the input list of binary digits.

# Analysis
This is the same function as before, but with a few fixes. The bug has been fixed, and the function now works correctly.

The first change is that the list is now being read as a list of integers instead of a list of binary digits. This is done by using the built-in map function to convert the list of binary digits to a list

# Analysis
The fixed function is supposed to take in a list of binary digits as input and convert it into a decimal number. However, it doesn't perform this function correctly.

The code tries to read the input as a list of integers, which is incorrect because it should be reading it as a list of binary digits.

The code then goes through each binary

# Analysis
The code has been fixed to correctly convert a list of binary digits to a decimal number. The code now goes through each binary digit and if it's 1, it adds the corresponding power of 2 to the answer. And if it's 0, it simply skips it and moves on to the next digit.
