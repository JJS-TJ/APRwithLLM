# Analysis

1. The buggy code is trying to count the number of '>' characters in a string.
2. The code is using a list a to store the lengths of consecutive '>' characters. If the current character is '<', it adds the length of the last sequence of '>' characters to the list a and resets the counter.
3. After the loop, it checks if there is a remaining sequence of '>' characters. If there is, it adds the length of this sequence to the list a.
