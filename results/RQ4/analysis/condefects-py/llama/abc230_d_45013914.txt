# Analysis
This code is supposed to calculate the minimum number of breaks needed to fix all broken wall panels.
However, the code has several bugs:

1. The wall list is sorted based on the first element of each sublist, but it should be sorted based on the second element of each sublist.

2. The code is using a deque data structure to store the wall panels, but the deque is not needed for this problem. A simple list would suffice.
