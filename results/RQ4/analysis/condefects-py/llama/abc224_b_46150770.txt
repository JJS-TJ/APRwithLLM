# Analysis
// Analysis
This code is supposed to check if a 2D matrix A satisfies the following property:
For every pair of rows (a, b) and columns (c, d), the sum of A[a][c] and A[b][d] is not greater than the sum of A[a][d] and A[b][c].

However, the function fails to correctly compare the sums of the elements. The code should check if the sum of A[a][c] and A[b][d] is not greater than the sum of A[a][d] and A[b][c].

Here is the corrected code:
