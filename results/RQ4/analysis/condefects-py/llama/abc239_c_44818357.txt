# Analysis
Analysis:

The buggy function takes four inputs for the coordinates of two points in a 5x5 grid. 
It then checks if the absolute difference between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points are within a certain range.
If they are, it prints "Yes", otherwise "No". However, the checks for the coordinates are not correct.

For example, when the absolute difference between x-coordinates is 3 and y-coordinates is 1, 
the code should print "Yes" but it doesn't because the check for y-coordinates is only for [1, 3],
not for 1. Similarly, the check for x-coordinates is [0, 4] but the condition for x-coordinates is 4,
which should also be included in the range.

The function should be modified to include these missing conditions in the checks for x-coordinates and y-coordinates. 
For instance, for the first condition, it should be `if abs(x1 - x2) in [1, 3] and abs(y1 - y2) in [1, 3]:` 
to include the points (2, 2) and (
