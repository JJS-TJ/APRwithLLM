# Analysis
The buggy function checks if the character pattern in a grid is correct and prints the coordinates of the top-left corner of the pattern if a match is found. However, it does not check if the pattern is exactly 4 characters long, which could lead to an index error. This can be solved by changing the range of the inner loop to m-4, and by changing the slicing indices in the if statement to m-4 and m-1, respectively. 

Also, the function should print the coordinates of the top-left corner of the pattern, so the indices i and j in the print statement should be incremented by one. 

Lastly, the function should stop searching after it has found a match, not continue to the end of the grid
