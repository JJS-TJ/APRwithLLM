# Analysis
Analysis:
This program is trying to generate a new string SS by repeating the input string S for i=0 to 5 times. It then checks
No.3 Patch
S = input()
for i in range(6):
    SS = S*(i+1)
    if len(SS) == 6:
        print(SS)
        break

Analysis:
In the buggy program, the variable SS is being set to S*i. However, the length of S*i is not equal to 6.

Analysis:
This program first creates a string
