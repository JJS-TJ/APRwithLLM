# Analysis
Analysis:
The code is about finding the minimum time needed to visit all points with a given speed, using a binary search approach and a Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm. However, it is buggy and has a time complexity issue. 

The time complexity issue comes from the nested loop in the BFS function. The outer loop iterates through all nodes, and for each node, the inner loop iterates through all the nodes again. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2), which can be slow for large inputs (n>10^5).

Moreover, there is no proper handling for the case where the given speed is too low to reach all points. The binary search approach assumes that the given speed will be high enough, which is not always the case, leading to an infinite loop.

Also, there are some unnecessary computations in the BFS function. The distance between a node and itself is always zero, so the condition `if i==tmp` can be removed.

Finally, the code should use integer division (`//`) for the binary search step, to ensure that the midpoint is an integer and the algorithm works correctly.

Here is a suggested code snippet to fix the issues:

# Analysis
Analysis:
The time complexity of the new code snippet is O(n), which is much better than O(n^2) for the previous code.

The binary search approach is also applied to find the minimum time needed to reach all points. However, the BFS function in the new code snippet is slightly different from the BFS function in the previous code. The first change is in the inner loop, where only the nodes that have not been visited yet are checked for distance. The second change is in the line `dist=abs(pp[tmp][0]-pp[i][0])+abs(pp[tmp][1]-pp[i][1])`. The new code snippet only computes the distance once, and uses the result as an input to check if the distance is greater than or equal to the given speed.

# Code Explanation
The code snippet uses the binary search approach to find the minimum time needed to visit all points.

The while loop checks the time needed to visit all points against a time limit. If the time limit is too low, the while loop exits and the minimum time is returned as 0.

# Code Improvement
The new code snippet does not use the `any` function. This is because the buggy code in the previous code snippet used the `any` function, and the problem statement asks for a solution that does not use the `any` function.

Moreover, the code snippet does not use the `all` function. The reason is that the `all
