# Analysis
This code is fixed based on the above analysis:

1. The wall list is sorted based on the second element of each sublist.

2. The code is using a deque data structure to store the wall panels, but the deque is not needed for this problem. A simple list would suffice.

3. The code is checking if the next wall panel overlaps with the current wall panel. If the next wall panel overlaps with the current wall panel

# Analysis

1. In this solution, we sort the wall list based on the second element of each wall panel. The first element of each wall panel is the start of the wall, so we can safely assume that the second element of each wall panel is the end of the wall.

2. Instead of using a deque, a simple list is used.

3. Each wall panel is considered individually, and we check if it overlaps
