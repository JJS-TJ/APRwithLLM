The fixes are:
1. Changed the variable names to reflect their meaning. This makes it easier to read the code.
2. Added a check to see if the list has at least two elements before using the first two elements.
3. Changed the code to check if the input is in the expected format.
4. Added a check to see if the "c" list has elements that are not in the "ds" dictionary. The code now prints the first

This function has improved a lot!
1. The input is clearly defined. The name of the variables "n" and "m" clearly indicate the number of students and number of subjects.
2. The variable names "c" and "d" are used to store the result of the input().split() function. This is a good practice as it improves the code readability.
3. The code now checks for invalid inputs. If an input is invalid, the code
