# Analysis


# The main idea of this problem is to find a way to count the number of 
# swapping in the original array. 
# 
# We can notice that if a pair of numbers in the array is swapped,
# the number of swapping will increase by 1.
# This means we only need to know if the largest element is on the left of the smallest element.
# 
# If the condition holds, the answer will be the largest number of the array.
# Otherwise, the answer will be the smallest number of the array.
