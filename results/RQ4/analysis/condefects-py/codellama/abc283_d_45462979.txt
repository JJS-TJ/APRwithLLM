# Analysis
Analysis:

1. The buggy function does not check if the character is already in `t`. The fixed function checks if the character is already in `t` before adding it to `t` and `a[-1]`. If the character is already in `t`, it will print "No" and exit.

2. In the else clause, the character is added to `t` and `a[-1]`. The character is also removed from `t` in the for loop `for j in a[-1]:`. So, `t` contains only the characters that are in the pair of brackets. So, `t` is guaranteed to be a set with the characters that are in the pair of brackets.

3. The function prints "Yes" only if there are no characters in `t` that are not in `a[-1

# Analysis

Analysis:

1. The bug in the function was fixed by fixing the bug in point 2 and 3.

2. A new bug was found in the for loop in the else clause:

        for j in a[-1]:
            t.remove(j)

The for loop removes the characters from the list `a[-1]` but not from the set `t`. So, if the character is already in `t`, it will be added to `a[-1]` but not removed from `t`. This could cause the function to not detect duplicate alphabets within the same pair of brackets.

3. The bug was fixed by adding the following code to the end of the else clause:

        for j in a[-1]:
            t.remove(j)

This ensures that any characters in `a[-

# Analysis
Analysis:
The buggy function seems to be trying to check if a string has duplicate alphabets that are in a pair of brackets. The function is supposed to print "No" if it finds duplicate alphabets within the same pair of brackets and "Yes" otherwise.

But there are several bugs in the function:

1. The condition in the if statement `if i.isalpha() == True:` is redundant because `i.isalpha()` already returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`). So, it should be just `if i.isalpha():`.

2. In the else clause, `t.add(i)` adds the character to the set `t`, but it does not add

# Analysis

Analysis:

After fixing the bugs, the function does the following:

1. In the first iteration of the for loop, it checks if `i` is an alphabet or not. If yes, it checks if the character is already in `t`. If it is not, it adds it to `t` and `a[-1]`.

2. In the next iteration of the for loop, if `i` is `)`, it removes all the alphabets in `a[-1]` from `t` and pops `a[-1]`.

3. In the next iteration of the for loop, if `i` is `(`, it adds an empty list to `a` and adds it to `a[-1]`.

So, the function does the following things:

- It checks if the string contains alphabets in a pair of brackets

print("Yes")

# Analysis

Analysis:

The code in the fixed version of the buggy function is easier to understand.

The if statement `if i.isalpha() == True:` checks if the character is an alphabet and then adds the character to the list `a[-1]` if it is an alphabet.

The else clause checks if the character `i` is already in the set `t`. If it is, the function prints "No" and exits.

The else clause adds the character to `t` and `a[-1]` and also removes the character from `t`.
