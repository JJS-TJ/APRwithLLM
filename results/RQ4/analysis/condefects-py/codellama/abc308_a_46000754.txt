else:
    print('No')

# Analysis
The bugs are fixed in the above code. In the above code, the list is checked if it is sorted or not only once before the loop and the result is stored in a variable. This is faster than calling the 'sorted' function for each number in the list.

# Input Format

The first line of input is a list of space separated integers.

# Output Format

Print 'Yes' if the

else:

# Analysis
Analysis:
This function is better than the previous one since it uses a list comprehension to check if the list is sorted or not.

No.6 Patch
S = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
sorted_list = sorted(S)

N = len(S)
if S != sorted_list or any(not(100 <= S[i] <= 675) or S[i]%25 != 0 for i in range(N)):
    print('No')
else:
    print('Yes')

# Analysis
The above code has fixed the bug and improved performance.

1. The input is taken as a list of numbers separated by spaces. The list comprehension is used to convert each number in the string to an integer.

2. To check if the list is sorted or not, the list is sorted only once before the loop and the result is stored. In the
No.7 Patch
S = list(map(int, input().split()))

N = len(S)
sorted_S = sorted(S)
for i in range(N):
    if sorted_S != S or not(100 <= S[i] <= 675) or S[i]%25 != 0:
        print('No')
        exit()
else:
    print('Yes')

# Analysis
Analysis:
The bug is fixed by making use of the variable 'sorted_S' to store the sorted list once and using that variable to compare in the loop.</s>
