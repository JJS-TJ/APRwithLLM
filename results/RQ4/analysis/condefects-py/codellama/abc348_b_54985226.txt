# Analysis
// Analysis
This version of the code only calculates the distance once instead of every iteration. It also prints the answer only after the loop is done.

This makes the code run much faster since the inner for loop is only being called once per point instead of N times for each point.

The only bug in this code is that the variable ans is reused, so the value will only be assigned to the final point. To fix this, change the name of the variable.

The final version of the code:

            dist=math.sqrt((x-x_i)**2+(y-y_i)**2)
            ans=i
    print(ans)

# Analysis
The fixed code is just the same as the buggy code except for the line that prints the answer.

# Explanation
The buggy code was printing the wrong answer at the end of the loop because it was overwriting the value of ans with the index of the last point.

The fixed code prints the value of ans after the loop has finished.

            ans=i
    print(ans)

# Analysis
// Analysis
The difference in this code is that the print() statement is no longer inside the for loop.

The buggy code prints a number for each point (x,y) in the list of points. The correct code only prints a number once after the for loop has completed.

# Analysis
// Analysis
The fixed code is just the same as the buggy code except that the answer is only printed after the loop is finished.

This is the only change that needs to be made to the code to fix the bug.

The program now works properly!

            ans=i
    print(ans)

# Analysis
// Analysis
The fix is pretty straightforward, the code just needs to print the answer at the end instead of printing the index for each point.

# Example

## Input
```
5
1 1
1 2
2 1
3 1
2 2
```

## Output
```
3
2
2
2
3
```

## Explanation

The furthest points from the origin are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (3, 1).

# Analysis
// Analysis
This code fixes the bug. Instead of storing the index of the point with the maximum distance and printing the result, this code calculates the distance from the current point to all other points and only prints the answer after the loop finishes.

This means that once the loop is finished, the variable ans stores the index of the point with the maximum distance from the current point.
