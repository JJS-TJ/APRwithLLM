# Analysis
The fixed function first checks if M >= H[i]. The code breaks if M >= H[i] is false, so if M is less than H[i], the code breaks and prints i+1. 

The fixed code handles the case where M is negative by simply printing N since the monster can't defeat the monster if M is negative. 

The fixed code also handles the case where the monster can defeat the monster without moving to the next building by simply
