# Analysis
The above corrected function diff() now also compares the length of the strings. If the length of the two strings differ by more than 1, it will not find the difference. Therefore, we need to add an extra condition to the if statement in the corrected function. This will ensure that the correctness of the new function.

The difference in the complexity of the correct function and the incorrect function is O(M) instead of O(NM) because the function does not traverse each character of the two strings separately. Therefore, the correct function is faster than the

# Analysis
The fixed function diff() now correctly computes the difference between two strings, accounting for the possibility that they have different lengths.

# Incorrectness of the given code

In the given code, the else block will not be reached if the for-loop breaks from the middle, so we need to add an else clause to print "No".

# Analysis
Correct Analysis:

The above function diff() now also compares the length of the two strings. If the length of the two strings are unequal, it computes the absolute value of the difference between the lengths of the two strings. Since the length of the string can go up to 200,000, this is not an efficient way to solve the problem. However, this is the only way to find the difference in the strings that is the problem requires.

# Analysis

The code is now correct as the function diff() now also compares the length of the two strings. If the lengths are unequal, it adds the difference of the lengths to the number of differences.

# Analysis
The above fixed version of the function diff() will now give the correct
output in all the cases. 

# How to Compare the Output

The above version of the function diff() will not give the same output as the previous version when the input strings are of unequal length. For example, for the following inputs, the above version of the function diff() will print "No" as output, while the previous version of the function diff() will print "Yes":
