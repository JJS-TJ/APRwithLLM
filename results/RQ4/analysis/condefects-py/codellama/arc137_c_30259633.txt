# Analysis
Analysis:
This function takes an integer N and a list of integers A as input. It then checks two conditions. If the difference between the last two elements of A is greater than or equal to 2, it prints "Alice" and exits. If this is not the case, it checks if N modulo 2 is equal to the last element of

# Analysis
We see that the original function does not terminate in the case that the last two numbers in the list differ by 2 or more. This is because there are no checks to make sure that the subtractions of 1 and 2 do not cause an integer underflow. The fixed version of the function corrects
