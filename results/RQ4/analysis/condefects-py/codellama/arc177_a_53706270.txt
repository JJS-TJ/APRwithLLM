# Analysis
Analysis:
The code is designed to check whether it is possible to exchange a given amount using different denominations of notes. 
The code seems to have a logical flaw in the while loops where it is supposed to deduct the value of each note from the respective denomination value. 
The wrong code has used the assignment operator (=) instead of the subtraction operator (-=).
This is a very common mistake and it is happening in the loop for each note denomination.

The correct code should be:

while(X[i] >= 500 and F > 0):
    X[i] -= 500
    F -= 1
  while(X[i] >= 100 and E > 0):
    X[i] -= 100
