# Analysis
// Analysis
The given code is a python script for calculating the minimum number of operations to make the list al[] a multiple of a, b, c, and their combination. 

However, there are several bugs in the code.

1. The function calc() is not correct. It should return the smallest multiple of y that is not less than x, but it is incorrectly returning the largest multiple of y that is not greater than x.

2. The function dp is not correctly populating the dp list. The dp list should be populated based on the minimum operations required to make the number a multiple of a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, and abc. The code is trying to populate dp based on incorrect conditions and incorrect assignments.

3. The condition for dp[i+1][int('011',2)] is incorrect. It should be dp[i][int('110',2)] instead of dp[i][int('011',2)].

4. The condition for dp[i+1][int('111',2)] is incorrect. There are multiple conditions that should be checked to find the minimum operations. The correct conditions should include dp[i][int('011',2)]+d[int('100',2)], dp[i][int('101',2)]+d[int('010',2)], and dp[i][int('110',2)]+d[int('001',2)].

5. The last print statement is incorrect. It should print the minimum number of operations to make the last number in the list a multiple of a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, and abc, not the minimum number of operations to make a number a multiple of 7.

6. The gcm function does not need to be defined separately. Python's built-in math.gcd function can be used.

Correct the code by fixing the bugs and simplifying the function calls.
