# Analysis

Analysis:

1. The function has been fixed by adding a condition to check if the index is out of range before appending the elements to the 'tmp' list. The index is only appended to the 'tmp' list if it is within the range of the list.

2. After creating the 'tmp' list, it is appended to the 'ans' list.

3. Instead of converting the 'tmp'

# Analysis
Analysis:

1. The function uses list comprehension to create 'tmp' list. It is created within the loop so that the index 'i' is in scope.

2. After the list comprehension, the condition is checked to see if 'i' is equal to the length of the list. If it is, then the list is appended to the 'ans' list.

3. After all the strings are created and appended to the 'ans' list, it is sorted and the largest string is printed.

4. This implementation achieves the intended purpose of the function, which is to get the lexicographically largest string by moving in eight
