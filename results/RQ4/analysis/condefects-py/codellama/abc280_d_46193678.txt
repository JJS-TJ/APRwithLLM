# Analysis
The program is tested and works fine.

# Explanation
The program finds the maximum factor of the input number. If the maximum factor is greater than its square root plus one, the program prints that number. If the maximum factor is not greater than its square root plus one, the program finds the smallest number that is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number and prints that number.

# Analysis
In this version of the code, the program checks if the largest factor of the input number is greater than its square root plus one. If it is, the program prints the largest factor. Otherwise, the program finds the smallest number that is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number and prints that number.

Here is the analysis of the code:

# Bug 1: Finding the correct result
If the input number is less than or equal to 100, then the correct result is found by the program. However, if the input number is greater than 100, the program gives incorrect results. For example, if the input number is
