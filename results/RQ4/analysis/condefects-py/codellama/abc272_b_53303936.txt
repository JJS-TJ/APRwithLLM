# Analysis
Analysis:
The code now performs the required operation correctly. However, there is a flaw in the code. There is a logical error.

The code is checking if a pair of numbers is present in the given sets and if it is not, it is printing "No" and exiting the program. But it should continue to check other pairs of numbers.

Corrected Code:
Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
# Corrected Function
N, M = map(int, input().split())
X=[]
for _ in range
No.8 Patch
N, M = map(int, input().split())
X=[]
for _ in range(M):
  _, *x=map(int, input().split())
  X.append(set(x))
flag=False
from itertools import combinations
for cmb in combinations(range(1,N+1), 2):
  for i in X:
    if cmb[0] in i and cmb[1] in i:
      flag=True
      break
  else:
    print("No")
    exit()
print("Yes" if flag else "No") 

# Analysis
The corrected version of the code has proper indentation and also has a logical error correction.

The code has proper indentation now.

The code is checking if a pair of numbers is present in each of the given sets.

If it is present, it sets the flag to True and breaks out of the loop.

If it is not present, the program continues to check other pairs.

If it is not found, it prints "No" and exits the program.

Code Execution:
The following is the sample test case.

Test case:
5 5
5 1 2
