# Analysis
Analysis:
 
The code is trying to perform a mathematical computation based on given inputs N and M.
However, it seems to contain some logical errors or unclear logic that may cause it to produce incorrect results.

The bug(s) may lie in the way the calculations are done for ans.

# Analysis
Analysis:
 
The formula for f seems to calculate the permutation of N elements taken y at a time, modulo M. But this is not accurate as the formula for permutation is P(n, r) = n!/((n-r)!), where P is the permutation, n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to take. The code has P = P * (N +
