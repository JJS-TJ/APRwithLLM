print(distance)

# Analysis
The issues in the above code have been addressed.
1. The manhattan distance has been calculated correctly.
2. The code is handled the case where there is only one 'o' and no

# Analysis
The fix to the code is pretty simple. We have added the following lines of code:
if len(o) < 2:
    print(0)
else:
    ...
