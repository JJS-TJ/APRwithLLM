# Analysis:
The bugs in the original function are fixed in the revised function. The function now checks if the number of inputs provided by the user is equal to the expected 'n', and if 'k' is less than or equal to 'n'. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints an appropriate error message and exits. It also corrects the dynamic programming loop to avoid any possible errors when dp[i][j][l] is -1. The final output is also corrected to print dp[n][k][0] when d is 1, and dp[n][k][0] % d when d is not 1.

# Explanation
This code first checks if the user has entered exactly 'n' integers. If not, it exits the program. Then it initializes the dp table and fills up the table using dynamic programming. Finally, it prints the maximum sum of 'k' numbers chosen such that the sum is divisible by 'd'. If 'd' is not 1, it checks if such a sum exists in the dp table, and if it does not exist, it prints -1.

# Analysis
Analysis:
The given fixed code handles all the edge cases and bugs that were present in the buggy code. It checks if the user has provided exactly 'n' integers, and if 'k' is not greater than 'n'. It also handles the cases where dp[i][j][l] is -1 in the dynamic programming transition. The final output is the maximum sum of 'k' numbers chosen such that the sum is divisible by 'd' (which is 0 in this case).

# Analysis
The above-modified code will check if the input for list of integers 'a' is valid. If not, it will print "Invalid input". Also, it will check if 'k' is not greater than 'n' and handle the case when dp[i][j][l] is -1.

For the above code, dp[n][k][0] will always give the maximum sum of 'k' numbers chosen such that the sum is divisible by 'd'. This is because, we are always looking for the maximum sum which is divisible by 'd'. Therefore, it is always stored in dp[n][k][0]. 

The complexity of the code is O(n*k*d) as there are three nested loops each running for 'n', 'k' and 'd' iterations.

The space complexity is also O(n*k*d
