# Analysis
In this fixed function, the input is split into a list of integers. The list is then sorted and stored in 'S_sorted'. Then, the function checks each condition only once and compares the sorted list with the original list. If any condition is not met, it prints 'No' and exits the function.

# Analysis
This function works as expected. It takes a list of integers as input, checks each integer to see if it's within the range of 100 to 675 inclusive and is a multiple of 25. If the list is sorted in ascending order and all

# Analysis
This function fixes the bugs in the original function. It uses list comprehension to convert the input string to a list of integers. The list is sorted only once before the loop, and the sorted list is stored in the variable 'S_sorted'. The loop checks each number in the list to see if it satisfies the conditions.

# Analysis
This fixed function first converts the input to a list of integers. Then it sorts this list and stores it. After that, it loops over the original list and checks the conditions. If any condition is not met, it immediately breaks out of the loop and prints 'No'. If all conditions are met,

This function has been corrected. It first converts the input string to a list of integers using list comprehension. Then it sorts the list and stores the sorted list. It checks each number in the original list and the sorted list, if any number doesn't match, or if the
