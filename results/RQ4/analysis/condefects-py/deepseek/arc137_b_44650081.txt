# Explanation
# The bug in the original code is that the variable 'c1' was not initialized to 0 before its usage. This results in an error when the 'c1' value is compared with '0' in the 'max' function.
# This problem is fixed by initializing 'c1' to 0 before its usage. This makes the code correct and ensures that the maximum length of consecutive elements that are the opposite of each other is correctly calculated.

# Test the fixed function
