# Analysis
The fixed function has taken into account the modulo operation for both the product calculations. 
This ensures that the product of the numbers is always within the modulo range. 

However, note that this approach could result in negative numbers if a1 < a2, as the modulo operation 
will not correctly
No.1 Patch
a,b,c,d,e,f=map(int,input().split())
mod=998244353
a1=a%mod*b%mod*c%mod
a2=d%mod*e%mod*f%mod
print((a1-a2)%mod)

# Analysis
The fixed function now applies the modulo operation to the product calculation. This means that the product will be reduced to a value within the modulo range before it is subtracted. This ensures that the final result is always within the correct range and thus correct. 

For example, if a=b=c=d
No.4 Patch
a,b,c,d,e,f=map(int,input().split())
mod=998244353
a1=a*b%mod*c%mod
a2=d*e%mod*f%mod
print((a1-a2)%mod)

# Analysis
The fixed function applies the modulo operation immediately after each product, which ensures that the product is always less than or equal to the modulo. This prevents overflow and provides the correct results.

It also applies the modulo operation to the difference (a1-a2), as the difference could be negative and the modulo operation can change

Analysis
The fixed function corrects the bug by adding the modulo operation in the product calculation. This ensures that the products never exceed the maximum value of the modulo and the result of the subtraction is correctly within the modulo range.

The result of the subtraction is
No.8 Patch

mod=998244353
a1=a%mod*b%mod*c%mod
a2=d%mod*e%mod*f%mod
print((a1-a2)%mod)

# Analysis
The fixed function applies the modulo operation after the product calculation. This ensures that the product values are kept within the range of the modulo operation.

Now, even if the inputs are large, the product values will be within the range of the modulo operation, and hence the subtraction will be performed correctly.
