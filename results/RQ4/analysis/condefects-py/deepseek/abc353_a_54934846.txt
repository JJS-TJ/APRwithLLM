# Analysis
Analysis:

The fixed function still takes a list of integers as input and tries to find the position of the first element that is greater than the first element of the list. The function now uses the all() function and a generator expression to check if all elements in the list are less than or equal to the first element. If this condition is true, it means that no element is greater than the first element, so it prints -1.

If the condition is false, it uses the next() function along with a generator expression to find the first element in the list that

Analysis:

The fixed function takes a list of integers as input and checks if all elements in the list are not greater than the first element. If they are all not greater, it means that there is no element greater than the first element in the list, and it prints -1. 

If there are elements that are greater than the first element, it finds the position of the first element that is greater than the first element using the next() function and list.index() method. The result is incremented by 1 to get the position from 1 instead of

# Analysis
Analysis:

The fixed function works by first checking if all elements in the list are less than or equal to the first element. If they are, it means that no element in the list is greater than the first element, so it prints -1. If not all elements are less than or equal to the first element, it finds the position of the first element that is greater than the first element and prints its position.

The all() function is a built-in Python function that returns True if all elements of

# Analysis
Analysis:

The fixed function still takes a list of integers as input. However, it uses the built-in Python functions all() and next() to check if all elements are less than or equal to the first element. If true, it means that no element is greater than the first element, so it should print -1. Otherwise, it finds the first element that is greater than the first element in the list and prints its index.

The function is more concise and readable, and it avoids unnecessary comparisons and increments. It also correctly prints
