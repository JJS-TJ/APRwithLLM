# Analysis
This function has been fixed to correctly identify the winner of the game. It should print "Alice" if either condition is met, and "Bob" otherwise. This is because the function is supposed to play a game where Alice goes first, and whoever cannot make a move (i.e., the player who has a number that is not greater than 1)
