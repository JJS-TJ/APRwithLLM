# Explanation
In the fixed code, the variable `result` is correctly used as a set to store the unique substrings. It checks if the substring is already in the set before adding it, and it adds the substring as a string of characters and the length. The length of the set `result` gives the number of unique substrings. The code also handles the case where the input string is of length 1 or 0.
