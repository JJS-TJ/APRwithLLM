# Explanation
The function `find_strongest_player` takes three arguments: the number of players `N`, the number of matches `M`, and a list of match results `matches`. Each match is represented as a tuple `(a, b)`, where `a` is the player who lost and `b` is the player who won. 

The function first creates a list `player` of all players. It then creates a list `losers` of all losers from the matches. Finally, it creates a list `strongest_player` of players who have not lost any game. 

If there is only one player in `strongest_player`, the function returns this player as the strongest player. Otherwise, it returns -1. 

The code then reads the input for the number of players `N` and matches `M`, and the list of match results. It calls the function `find_strongest_player` with these inputs and prints the result. 

The time complexity of the function is O(N+M) because it iterates over the list of players and the list of matches once. The space complexity is also O(

# Analysis
In this corrected code, I create a list `losers` to store all the losers. Then, I create a list `strongest_player` that only includes the players who have not lost any game. If there is only one player in this list, it is the strongest player. Otherwise, it prints -1.
