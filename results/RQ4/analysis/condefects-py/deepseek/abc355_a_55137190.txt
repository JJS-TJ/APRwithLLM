# Further Analysis

The code is designed to solve a problem where there are 3 unique integers (1, 2, 3). If A is not equal to B, the code should print -1. 
Otherwise, it should print the number that is not A and B. For example, if A is 1 and B is 2, the code should print 3, as 1 and 2 are the two numbers that are not 3.
This problem is a simple variation of a common coding interview question called "Identical Balls". The solution is to print
