# Analysis
In the fixed function, we first check if 'A' is less than 'B' before appending it to the list 'ans'. If 'A' becomes greater than 'B' in

while A<=B:
  ans.append(A)
  A+=D
print(*ans)

# Analysis
In this fixed function, we first create an empty list 'ans' to store the progression. 

Then, in the while loop, we first check if 'A' is less than or equal to 'B'. If it is,

while A<B:
  A+=D
  if A>B:

# Analysis
This function corrects the bug by checking if 'A' is greater than 'B' after adding 'D' to it. If 'A' is greater than 'B', it breaks the
No.3 Patch
A,B,D=map(int,input().split())
ans=[]
while A<=B:
  ans.append(A)
  A+=D
print(*ans)

# Explanation
This code corrects the buggy function by checking if 'A' is less than or equal to 'B' before appending it to the list 'ans'. Hence, no arithmetic progression greater than 'B' will be added
No.4 Patch
A,B,D=map(int,input().split())
ans=[]
while A<=B:
  ans.append(A)
  A+=D
print(*ans)

# Analysis
Analysis:
This fixed function checks whether 'A' is less than or equal to 'B' before appending 'A' to the list 'ans'. So, it will generate the correct arithmetic progression.

# Test Case
No.5 Patch
A,B,D=map(int,input().split())
ans=[]
while A<=B:
  ans.append(A)
  A+=D
print(*ans)

# Explanation
The logic of the fixed function is the same as the original buggy function, but the issue with the original function was that 'A' was being added to the list 'ans' before checking if 'A' was less than or equal
No.6 Patch

# Analysis
In the fixed function, we first check if 'A' is less than 'B'. If 'A' is greater than 'B', we break the loop. If 'A' is less
No.7 Patch
A,B,D=map(int,input().split())
ans=[]
while A<=B:
  ans.append(A)
  A+=D

# Analysis

In the fixed function, the value of 'A' is appended to the list 'ans' before it is incremented by 'D'. Also, a check is added to ensure that 'A' is less than or equal to '
No.8 Patch
A,B,D=map(int,input().split())

while A<=B:
  ans.append(A)
  A+=D

# Analysis
Analysis:
This fixed function works correctly by first checking if 'A' is less than or equal to 'B' before appending it to the list 'ans'. If the condition is satisfied, then only the value of 'A' is append

# Analysis
In the fixed function, a check is added to ensure that the next number to be appended to the list 'ans' is within the range 'A' and '
