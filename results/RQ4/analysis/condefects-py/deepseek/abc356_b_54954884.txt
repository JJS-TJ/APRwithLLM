# Analysis
The fixed function is essentially the same as the original function but with the bugs fixed. The "check_goal" function now correctly calculates the sum of each nutrition item and checks if it meets the goal. The result is stored in the "check" list. After the "check_goal" function has been called, the function checks if the sum of the "check" list is equal to M. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". This indicates whether all nutrition goals have been met or not. The fixed function also uses list comprehension to create the "nutrition" list, which is more efficient and concise.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜># Problem Name : 01. Number of Ones

# Analysis
This code is a fixed version of the original code. The bugs were fixed by:

1. Defining the "nut_num" variable as the index of the nutrition item that the function is checking.

2. Adding a check to make sure that the "nutrition" list is not empty before trying to access elements from it.

3. Returning the "check" list from the function and assigning the result to the "check" variable.

4. Checking if the "goal" list is empty before trying to access its elements.

5. Changing the "goal" variable to a list and changing the "nutrition" variable to a list of lists.

6. Changing the "sum_nut" function to be called only once and using list comprehension to create the "check" list.

# Analysis
The fixed function checks if the nutrition list is empty before trying to access its elements. It also checks if the goal list is empty before trying to access its elements. The function only checks if the sum of the values of a specific nutrition item in the list of nutritional values is greater than or equal to the target goal for that nutrition item. This is done by calling the "sum_nut" function once and passing the necessary variables to it. The function now returns the "check" list and assigns the result to the "check" variable. If the sum of the "check" list is equal to the number of nutrition items, the program prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No". If the nutrition list is empty, the program prints "No". This should fix
