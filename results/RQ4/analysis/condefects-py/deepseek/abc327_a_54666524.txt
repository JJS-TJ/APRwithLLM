# Analysis
Analysis:

1. The code starts by taking two inputs, an integer N and a string S. Then, it creates a list named "ok" containing the characters "a" and "b".

2. The code then

N = int(input())
S = input()
ok = ["a", "b"]
for i in range(N-1):
    if S[i] in ok and S[i+1] in ok and S[i] != S[i+1]:
        print("Yes")
        exit()
print("No")

# Explanation

1. The above code introduces a new condition in the if statement. This condition checks if the character at position i in the string S is not equal to the character at position i+1 in the string S.
