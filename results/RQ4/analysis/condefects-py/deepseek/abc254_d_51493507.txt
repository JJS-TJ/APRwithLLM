# Analysis
Analysis:

This function is trying to count the number of pairs (a,b) where a and b are in the range of 1 to n and where a*b<=n.
The function has been fixed to correctly calculate the product of the prime factors of "i" when their count is odd.
The variable "a" is correctly updated in the loop.
The condition "a*j <= n" is correctly taken care of in the loop.
The function now returns the correct output.

Test Cases:

Test Case 1:
Input: 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The pairs are (1,1) and (2,2).

Test Case 2:
Input: 4
Output: 4
Explanation: The pairs are (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and (3
