# Explanation
The fixed function now correctly reads the input as a list of binary digits. It then goes through each binary digit and if it's 1, it adds the corresponding power of 2 to the answer. Finally, it prints the answer, which is the decimal equivalent of the input list of binary digits.

The fixed function works as expected and correctly converts a binary
