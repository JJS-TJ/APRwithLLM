# Analysis
The corrected function will now correctly check if the sorted original list (asort) is the same as the sorted sublists (aksort). If it is not, the function will print "No" and exit. If it is, the function will print "Yes".

This code assumes that n and k are positive integers, and that a is a list of n integers.

The time complexity of the corrected function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operations. The space complexity is O(n) due to the space needed to store the original list (a), the sorted original list (asort), the sublists (ak), and the sorted sublists (aksort).
