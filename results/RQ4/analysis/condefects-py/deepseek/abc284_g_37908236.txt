# Analysis
The fixed function now calculates the permutation of N elements taken y at a time, modulo M, by multiplying the previous permutation P with (N + 1 - y) % M and then taking the power of (N - y) modulo M. This is then multiplied with the number of ways to choose y elements from N, which is calculated as (y - 1) * y // 2. The final result is calculated as ans * N % M. This should now give

# Analysis

The fixed code calculates f as P * (N ** (N - y)) % M, so it ensures that the result of the calculation is always modulo M.
This ensures that the intermediate results of the calculations do not grow too large, which can cause overflow errors.
Also, the calculation for ans is corrected to ensure that the result of the calculation is also modulo M.
This should fix the bug in the original code and give the correct result.
