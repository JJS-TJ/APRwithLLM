# Analysis
The corrected function works by comparing the two substrings directly using the "<" operator. This operator in Python compares the strings lexicographically, which means it compares them character by character. If the first string is lexicographically smaller, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

In the main code, the input string is split into two substrings using the slicing operator. The "for" loop is used to split the string at every possible position. The function "compare" is then used to check if the first substring is lexicographically smaller than the second substring. If it is, the "flag" is set to True and the loop is exited. At the end, the "flag" is checked. If it's True, it means the string can be split, so "Yes" is printed. Otherwise, "No" is printed.
