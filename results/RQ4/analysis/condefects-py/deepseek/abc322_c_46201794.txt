# Analysis

The fixed code fixes the bugs in the buggy function.

1. The second for loop is corrected to find the minimum number of steps to reach zero. It should compare the current index with the minimum of the next index and current index plus one.

2. The third for loop is corrected to print the minimum steps to reach zero. It runs from N-2 to 0 with a step of -1.

3. Input validation is added to check if the input values
