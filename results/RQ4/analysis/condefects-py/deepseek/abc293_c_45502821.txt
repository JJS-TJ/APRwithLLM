# Analysis
The fixed function uses depth-first search (DFS) to iterate through all possible paths. The function `dfs` is recursive and takes four arguments: the current x and y coordinates and a set of visited cells. The function first checks whether it has reached the end of the grid. If it has, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates over the two possible movements (right and down) and recursively calls `dfs` on the new coordinates if the new cell is not in the set of visited cells. The function adds the return value of `dfs` to `cnt`, which is the total number of valid paths.

The main part of the code creates the field and calls `dfs` to calculate the number of valid paths. The set of visited cells is initialized with the value of the cell at the start of the path.

This code fixes the bugs in the original function and is more efficient. It uses the set data structure to store visited cells, which makes checking whether a cell has been visited faster than using a list. It also uses recursion to simplify the code and make it more readable.

The time complexity of the fixed function is O(HW * 2^(HW)), as in the worst case it needs to iterate over all possible paths of length HW. The space complexity is also O(HW), as the maximum depth of the recursion is HW and the maximum size of the set of visited cells is HW.
