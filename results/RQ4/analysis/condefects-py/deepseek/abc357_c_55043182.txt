# Analysis
This function now correctly prints the desired pattern. It builds the carpet in a bottom-up manner, starting with a single cell and repeatedly doubling the size of the carpet. When it reaches the center square, it changes the cell to a "dot" instead of a "hash" to create the desired pattern. It also correctly prints the carpet row by row, as opposed to column by column.
