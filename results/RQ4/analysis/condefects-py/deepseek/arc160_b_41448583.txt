# Brief Explanation
# The bug in the given function is that the range of the for loop should start from 1 to the integer part of the square root of N. The reason is that if you start from 0, then num becomes 0 in the first iteration and you get an incorrect value of ans.

# The corrected function starts from 1 and goes up to num+1 in the range of the for loop. This will ensure that num becomes 1 in the first iteration and will correctly calculate the value of ans.

# This will fix the bug in the original function and will give the correct

# Analysis
# The bug in the original function is that it stops the loop at num, not num+1. This means that it misses the cases where y is equal to num, because the loop stops just before y is incremented to num+1. 
# By changing the loop condition to y<=num, the function includes all possible values of y in the range from 1 to num, and thus fixes the bug.

# Output should be 9
