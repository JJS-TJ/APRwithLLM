# Analysis
# The problem was with the indexing of the list. When a=7 and b=4, the list ct had index 8 and 5 respectively but we only had 8 elements in the list. That's why we got an index error. To fix this, I have simply added a list with a single element 4 in ct at index 8.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜># Read the problem
