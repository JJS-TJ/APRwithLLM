// The bug was in the for loop condition, it was set up so that the loop would end before the iteration was made with the cube of n. By changing the for loop condition to i*i*i <= n, we ensure that the loop runs till i*i*i is less than or equal to n. Hence, we can find the largest cube which is less than or equal to n.

// In the buggy function, the for loop condition checks if i * i * i is less than n. This is incorrect as it will not include the cube of n if it is a perfect cube itself.
// Hence, in the fixed function, I changed the loop condition to check if i * i * i is less than or equal to n.
// This way, the loop will run until i * i * i is equal to or greater than n, ensuring that n is included in the loop if it is a perfect cube.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>package com.example.recipes.ad
