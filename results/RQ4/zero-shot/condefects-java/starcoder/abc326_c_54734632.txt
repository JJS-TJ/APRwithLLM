// Input:
// First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line consists of an integer N and next line contains N spacestepenated integers.

// Output:
// For each testcase, print the required sum.

// Constraints:
// 1 <= T <= 100
// 1 <= N <= 105
// 1 <= A[i] <= 105

// Example:
// Input:
// 1
// 3
// 1 2 3
// Output:
// 6

// Explanation:
// Testcase 1: GCD(1, 1) + GCD(2, 2) + GCD(3, 3) = 1+1+3 = 6.

// Solution:
// We can use a map

### Explanation of the changes:

1. The bug in the original function was caused by the fact that the array `A` was initialized with a size of `N+1`, and then an element was inserted at index `0`. However, the code then starts iterating over the array from index `1`, so this was unnecessary. The array should be initialized with a size of `N`, and the first element can be treated separately without the need for index `0`.

2. The condition in the `while` loop of the original function was incorrect. It was checking if `A[l] <= A[r]` and `A[r] < A[l]+M`, which is incorrect because it should check if `A[r] < A[l]+M`, which is the condition for the right pointer to move forward.

3. The calculation of the maximum size of the segment in the original function was incorrect. It was calculating `r-l`, but it should be calculating `r-l+1` because the segment size is the difference

// Explaination: 
// The buggy function does not check if the r is less than or equal to N, which means if the r reaches the last element of the array A, the function will add 1 to r and check if A[r] is less than A[l]+M, which is invalid and it will not terminate the loop. 
// To fix this bug, we should add the condition r<=N in the while loop. Now, the function will check if r is less than or equal to N before checking if A[r] is less than A[l]+M. This will prevent the function from going out of bounds of the array A.
// The corrected function will now work as expected. It will correctly find the maximum length of the subsequence where all elements are within the range A[l] to A[l]+M.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>//src/main/java/org/example/model/Person.java
