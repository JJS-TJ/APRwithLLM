// The buggy function had a limit of 2000000, which was causing the program to run for a long time and taking up a lot of memory.
// The fix was to remove the limit and instead loop until x*x is less than or equal to D, and use a long data type for x.
// The change made to the loop ensures that the program now runs more efficiently and does not take up as much memory.

// For example, if D is 12, the output of the fixed function would be 1, 
// which is the minimum absolute difference between x*x + y*y and D for any positive integer y. 
// This is because 3*3 (which is x*x) is 9, and 9 + 1*1 (which is y*y) is 10, and the difference between 10 and 12 is 2, 
// which is the minimum possible difference for any positive integer y.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>import java.io.*; // for handling input/output

// Explanation
// The bug was in the type of variable "x" which was int and the loop was running till 2000000. The value of "x" was overflowing and causing an error.
// So, I have changed the type of "x" to long and the loop is running till 2000000 as expected.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>package com.example.lab5;
