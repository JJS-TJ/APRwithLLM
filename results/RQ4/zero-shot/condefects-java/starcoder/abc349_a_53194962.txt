// The bug was with the for loop. The loop was iterating from 1 to n - 1. This should be changed to 0 to n - 1.
// The starting point of the loop should be 0, not 1. This is because we want to include all numbers from 1 to n - 1.
// Starting from 1 means that the first number will not be included in the sum.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>/*
