// Explanation
// The bug in the original function is that it multiplies the answers for each iteration of the loop without modding the result. This leads to incorrect results and eventually overflows. To fix this, we need to mod the result of each multiplication operation to prevent overflow. This is done by adding a mod operation (%) after each multiplication operation.
// Also, the main function should mod the sum of the answers before printing. This is to prevent the final answer from exceeding the maximum value of an int type, which is the case when n and mod are large.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>// Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n factorial.

// Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.

// Example:
// n = 5
// n = 50

// Output:
// 1
// 12

// Solution:
public class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            n /= 5;
            count += n;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

// Explanation:
// The above solution is based on the fact that trailing zeros in n factorial are contributed by the number of 5s in n factorial.
// Since, there are more 2s than 5s in n factorial, we count the number of 5s in n factorial to get the number of trailing zeros.
// We do this by dividing n by 5 and adding the quotient to the count. This is done in a loop until n becomes 0.
// The loop runs in logarithmic time

// In the buggy function, the mod operation was applied to ans_left and ans_right separately instead of applying mod operation to each multiplication operation. The mod operation should be applied to each multiplication operation.

// This change will ensure that the result is always within the range of the mod value, which is required in many programming problems that involve modular arithmetic.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>// Provide a fix for the buggy function
