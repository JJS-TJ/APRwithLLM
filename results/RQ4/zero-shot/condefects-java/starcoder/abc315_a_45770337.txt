// Explanation
// The fix involves changing the String newText = ""; to a StringBuilder work = new StringBuilder();. StringBuilder is a class provided by Java which is used for creating mutable sequences of characters. It is more efficient than using String class since it's mutable (i.e., changes in the object can be made after it is created), and it provides a method append() which is used to append characters to the StringBuilder object.

// The original function was appending characters to a character array 'work', and then converting it into a String 'newText'. This was not efficient as a character array was being used, which is mutable. Instead, we can use StringBuilder, which is more efficient and easier to use, as it is mutable.

// In the original function, the String 'newText' was being created by concatenating characters, which was inefficient and slow. Instead, we can use the append() method of StringBuilder to append characters to the StringBuilder 'work', which is faster and more efficient.

// Finally, the original function was checking if the String 'newText' is empty or not, and if it is, it was printing the original String 'text'. In the fixed function, we can check if the length of the StringBuilder 'work' is 0 or not, and if it is, we can print the original String 'text'.

// Note: This solution assumes that the input string will not contain a very long sequence of consonants. If the string can be very long, it may be

// Explanation
// The buggy function is creating an array of characters, and adding the non-vowel characters to that array.
// This is inefficient, because it creates a new array that is as big as the size of the input string,
// which can lead to unnecessary memory usage.

// The fixed function uses a StringBuilder instead of an array of characters. StringBuilder is more efficient for string manipulations
// because it doesn't need to create a new array, and it can grow and shrink dynamically as needed.
// This means that it uses less memory, and it can handle longer strings more efficiently.

// In addition, the fixed function is using the append method of StringBuilder instead of the + operator to concatenate strings.
// The + operator creates a new string every time it is used, which can be expensive in terms of memory and processing time
// if used in a loop. StringBuilder, on the other hand, keeps a buffer of characters, and only creates a new string when necessary.

// Lastly, the fixed function is using the equals method of the String class to compare the contents of the strings,
// instead of the == operator. The == operator compares references, not the contents of the strings.
// This can lead to unexpected results if the strings are created in different ways.
// For comparing strings, the equals method should always be used.
