// This buggy function was taking input n+1 times, but it should take n times. So, the input loop should start from 1 instead of 0. 
// It should also start adding elements to the TreeSet from 1 to k-1, not just k. 
// And finally, the for loop which is used to calculate the minimum difference should run from 1 to n-k+1. 
// After all these fixes, the function should work correctly.
// The buggy code was not reading the last element of the array p and that's why it was giving wrong output. The fix is to make the for loop for reading elements run from 1 to n, not n+1. 
// The fix was also to make the TreeSet add elements from 1 to k-1 and to calculate the minimum difference run from 1 to n-k+1.

// Explanation 
// The initial buggy function had an off-by-one error which prevented it from correctly reading the input for the integer array. 
// This issue was corrected by changing the loop condition from "i < k" to "i <= k" when reading the input for the integer array. 
// Also, when adding elements to the TreeSet, the loop condition was changed from "j < n-k+1" to "j <= n-k+1" to ensure all elements are considered.
// The buggy function also had an off-by-one error in the indexing of the array. It was corrected by changing the index of the array in the TreeSet from "p[j+k-1]" to "p[j+k]". 
// Lastly, the buggy function did not print the correct output. It was corrected by removing the print statement that was printing the last and first elements of the TreeSet.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>// Problem link: https://www.codechef.com/problems/DOR
