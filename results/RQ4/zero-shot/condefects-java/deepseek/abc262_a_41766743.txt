// The original function was not working properly due to an infinite loop. It was missing a break condition to stop the loop when a valid solution was found. The fixed function now includes a while loop that will continue to iterate until a solution is found, and then return from the function.

// The fixed function also avoids the use of a for loop in this case, since a for loop would also need a break condition to stop the loop when a solution is found. A while loop is a better fit for this scenario, as it does not have a predetermined number of iterations and can break when a solution is found.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>package net.juanxxiii.j2eeg
