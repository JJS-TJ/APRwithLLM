// In the above code, the bug was in the for loop condition. The loop was running from n-1 to 0 but it should be running from n-1 to 1. This is because when total>=4 then the loop should break and no need to decrement the value of ans in the last iteration of the loop. So, if we start from n-1 to 1, then it won't decrement the ans value for the last iteration which is required. So, this bug is fixed by changing the condition in the loop from n-1 to 1.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>package com.company;
