// Explanation
// The buggy code was using the division operator (/) instead of the modulus operator (%). The division operator (/) returns the quotient from the division of two numbers, while the modulus operator (%) returns the remainder from the division of two numbers.

// So in the buggy code, n / 5 was checking if n is divisible by 5, and if so, it was printing n. But this is not what the original intention was. The intention was to check if n is a multiple of 5, and if not, to modify n to be a multiple of 5.

// The fix was to replace n / 5 with n % 5. n % 5 will return 0 if n is divisible by 5

/*
Explanation:

The bug in the original function was in the conditional statement where it checks if n is divisible by 5. Instead of using the division operator '/', the modulus operator '%' should be used to find the remainder of n divided by 5. 

This is because '/' is integer division which discards the remainder, but we want to know if the remainder is 0 (which means n is divisible by 5). The modulus operator '%' gives us the remainder of the division, which is exactly what we want to know. 

In the updated function, the bug is fixed and now the conditional statement is using the modulus operator '%' to check if n is divisible by 5. The rest of the code remains the same and

// Explanation
// The original function was not correctly using the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder of the division operation (n / 5).
// It was instead using the division operator (/) which is incorrect because the modulus operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation.
// The function was also incorrectly checking if (n / 5 == 0) instead of checking if (n % 5 == 0), which checks if n is divisible evenly by 5.

// The fixed function now correctly uses the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder of the division operation (n % 5), and checks if (n % 5 == 0) instead of (n / 5 == 0).
// This change ensures that the function correctly determines

// In the fixed function, it is checking if n % 5 == 0 which is correct as it checks for the remainder when n is divided by 5. If the remainder is 0, it means n is divisible by 5.
