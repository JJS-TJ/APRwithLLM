// This fix is required because the original code will print -1 when the maximum odd count number is 0, but the problem statement says that 0 is a valid answer for such cases. So, we need to check if the maximum odd count number is 0 and print 0 instead of -1.

The counting out begins at some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.
