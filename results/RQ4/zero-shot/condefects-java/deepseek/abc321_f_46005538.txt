// Explanation
// The bug in the original function is in the subtraction operation. In the buggy code, when a negative number is obtained from subtraction, it is simply converted to a positive number using the modulus operation. But it should be converted to a positive number plus the modulus. This is done in the fixed function by adding the modulus in subtraction operation. This ensures the result is always a positive number.

// It's important to note that the modulus operation is used to prevent overflow when adding very large numbers together. If the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the data type, the modulus operation allows it to "wrap around" to a smaller value.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>// The original function is buggy and will not work correctly for large inputs

// The bug in the original code was that the code was not handling negative numbers properly when the "-" operation was performed. The mod operation does not behave as expected for negative numbers in some languages (like Java), so we had to add "mod" to prevent negative numbers.

// The line "dp[i] = (dp[i] - dp[i - x]) % mod;" was changed to "dp[i] = (dp[i] - dp[i - x] + mod) % mod;" to handle the negative numbers when "-" operation is performed. This change ensures that the result of the subtraction operation will always be a non-negative number.

}

// Explanation
/*
The buggy code doesn't handle negative modulo operations correctly.
Specifically, the line dp[i] = (dp[i] - dp[i - x]) % mod; can result in negative values, which are not allowed in modulo operations.
To fix this, we can add mod to the subtraction result before taking the modulo, like so: dp[i] = (dp[i] - dp[i - x] + mod) % mod;.
This guarantees that the result will always be a positive number, allowing us to perform the modulo operation without any unexpected results.
