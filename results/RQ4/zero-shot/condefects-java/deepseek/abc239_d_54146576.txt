// In the buggy function, the program prints "Aoki" after it has checked all the numbers in the given range, regardless of whether it has found a pair of numbers whose sum is not a prime number.
// However, in the fixed function, the program returns "Takahashi" immediately once it finds a pair of numbers whose sum is not a prime number, and does not continue to check the remaining numbers.
// This is because the return statement is used to end the execution of the function and prevent it from continuing to the next lines of code.
// This change in behavior is what the problem statement is asking for: "If Takahashi can win the game, print Takahashi; otherwise,

// The bug in the function was that it did not break out of the inner loop when it found a prime number. Hence, the function was always outputting 'Takahashi' even when it should output 'Aoki'. The bug has been fixed by adding a break statement inside the inner loop.

// The second bug was that if the function did not find a prime number in the inner loop, it was not outputting 'Aoki'. The bug has been fixed by returning from the function after the output statement. This ensures that the function does not output 'Aoki' if it did not find a prime number in the inner loop.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>// A buggy version of the code:

// Explanation:
// The bug in the original function is that it does not break out of the inner loop when it finds a prime sum. This means that even after finding a prime sum, it would continue to check the rest of the numbers in the inner loop, which is unnecessary. This leads to the program printing "Takahashi" even when it should print "Aoki". The fixed function breaks out of the inner loop when it finds a prime sum, which makes the program function as expected.

// The return statement is also added to end the function immediately after printing "Takahashi". This is because once the program has printed "Takahashi", there's no need to

// The bug in the initial function was that the inner loop was not being exited when a pair of numbers (i, j) was found that sums to a prime number. This caused the function to incorrectly output "Aoki" when it should have outputted "Takahashi". The fix was to add a break statement after the if statement within the inner loop to exit the loop once a pair of numbers that sum to a prime number is found.

// The second bug was that "Aoki" was being outputted at the end of the function regardless of the results of the loops, which is incorrect. The fix was to add a return statement after the out statement in the if statement within the
