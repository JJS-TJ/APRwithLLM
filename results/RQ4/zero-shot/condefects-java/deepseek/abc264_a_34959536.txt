In the buggy function, the substring method was being used without adjusting the input values to fit the Java String substring method's indexing system, which is zero-based. Therefore, for a substring to be obtained from the 3rd to the 4th character, l should be 2 and r should be 4. However, the

// This problem occurs due to the fact that the indices in Java and many other languages start at 0, not 1. 
// So, if we have a string "atcoder" and we want to get the substring from the 2nd index to the 4th index, we should use s.substring(1, 4) (in
