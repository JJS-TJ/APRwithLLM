// Explanation:
// The original function was incorrect because it was adding 2 to n/c instead of 1, which caused an off by one error. 
// The corrected function now subtracts 1 from n/c when n is divisible by c to correctly index into the string a. 
// If n is not divisible by c, the function simply divides n by c to get the index of the character in string a. 
// This ensures that the character at the correct index is returned as per the problem requirements.

// Test case:
// Input: 3 9
// Output: C

// The bug in the original code was that it was adding 2 instead of just using n / c when the remainder was not equal to 0, this would cause an index out of bounds exception because n / c + 2 would exceed the length of string 'a'. The fixed code simply uses n / c when the remainder is not equal to 0, this will always return a valid index within the range of 'a' string.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>package com.example.sirishaa.todoapp;

// The buggy function used 'n / c + 2' to get the character of the string 'a' and 'n / c - 1' to get the character of the string 'a'.

// The fixed function now simply uses 'n / c' to get the character of the string 'a'.
// This will return the correct character as the indexes are zero-based.

// The buggy function was also printing an extra space after the character.

// Explanation:
// The bug in this code is that it always adds 2 to the quotient of n and c when n is not divisible by c. 
// This will lead to an out of range error if the result is greater than the length of the string.
// Instead, it should use the quotient of n and c when n is not divisible by c.

// Description
// The buggy function was trying to print the character at index n / c + 2 when n % c != 0. But since n / c gives the quotient, adding 2 to it would give incorrect results. 
// When n % c is not equal to 0, it should print the character at index n / c instead.
