// Explanation: The bug was in the while loop inside else block. It was checking if end is less than or equal to st but it should be strictly less than.
// In the fixed code, I changed the condition from end>=st to end>st. This will make sure that the loop runs till end is strictly less than st.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>// Provide a fix for the buggy function

// In the buggy function, the while loop was running from end to st instead of st to end. This resulted in some test cases failing because it was not checking the array elements from start to end but from end to start. 
// So, to fix the bug, we need to change the condition inside the while loop from end>=st to end>=st.
// This will ensure that the while loop runs from start to end and checks the elements in the array from start to end. This will help to correctly identify whether the array can be sorted by reversing a sub-array.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>// A. The Great Julya Calendar

// There is a calendar with 30 rows and 7 columns, each cell in the grid represents a day of the month of July.
// The cell in the first row and the first column is the first day of July, the cell in the last row and the last column is the 30th day of July.
// Julya is very good at mathematics, so he likes the numbers 7, 14, 21, and 28.
// He wants to count the number of days of July that are the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th day of the month.

// Your task is to help Julya to count the number of days of July that are the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th day of the month.

// Input
// The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
// Each test case consists of one line with two integers
