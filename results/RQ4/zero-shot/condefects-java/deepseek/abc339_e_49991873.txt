// This fix is based on the fact that in the buggy function, the line "tree[x] = value;" should be moved to after the loop.
// This is because, the buggy function updates the tree[x] with the given value and then immediately overwrites it with the maximum value of the updated array.
// To fix this, we should first update the tree[x] with the maximum value of the array and then update it with the given value. 
// This way, the tree[x] will always hold the maximum value of the array after the update operation.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>

// The buggy function updates the value in the tree but does not update the value in the parent nodes, hence making the parent nodes out of date.
// This is fixed by updating the parent nodes after updating the leaf nodes, so that the maximum value in the path from the root to the leaf node is maintained.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>// Given an array of distinct integers, find length of the longest subarray which contains numbers that can be arranged in a continuous sequence.

// The buggy function seems to attempt to update the tree with the given value at every index that is responsible for the given index x.
// However, the buggy function doesn't actually update the tree correctly because it uses the value at index (x - i) to update the value at index x,
// rather than using the current value of tree[x] and the given value to update the value of tree[x].
// This can lead to incorrect results, as the value at index x might already be larger than the value at index (x - i).
