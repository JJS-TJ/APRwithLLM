// Explanation:
// The bug in the original function was with the line for(int j = i+1; j < sl; j++). This was causing the program to miss some possible substring combinations, as it was not allowing j to be equal to i. This is because the original function was only considering substring ranges that started at i+1, but not at i. 
// The fix was simply to change the line for(int j = i+1; j < sl; j++) to for(int j = i; j < sl; j++). This allows the function to consider all possible substring ranges starting from i, ensuring all possible combinations are considered.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>// Buggy Function
