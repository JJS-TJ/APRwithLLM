# Explanation
# The error in the code lies in the B = B - 1 line. The bug here is that you have used B = B - 1 instead of B -= 1. This causes the code to subtract 1 from B but not to store the result back in B. This would mean that B would always be 1 less than the original value, causing an infinite loop. The solution is to use B -= 1, which subtracts 1 from B and stores the result back in B.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
