# Fixes
# 1. The buggy function did not take any inputs from the user, so I added two input() statements to get the number of test cases and the number to be checked.
# 2. The buggy function did not include the list of tuples for the ranges, so I included that in the fixed function.
# 3. The buggy function did not properly limit the range to n, so I added a min() function to limit r to n.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
