# The bug in the buggy function was that it was checking if the total number of bags is less than N and not if it is greater or equals to N.
# So, it was ignoring the cases where the total number of bags is exactly N, therefore the fix was to change the less than operator to a greater than or equals operator.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
