# Explanation:
# In the buggy function, the if statement in the for loop is checking if the length of G[i] (which is a list) is equal to 1.
# This will always return False because the length of a list is always greater than or equal to 1.
# Instead, we should check if the length of G[i] (which is a list) is equal to 1,
# which indicates that the vertex i is a leaf node in the graph.
# The buggy function is trying to find the center nodes of the tree,
# which are the vertices that have a degree of 1 (except for the root).
# The fixed function now correctly identifies these nodes and calculates the number of edges each node has.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>
