/* The code was wrong because the printf function used for printing the student grade had a typo, the typo is in the "an" word between "Student has an" and the grade letter. In some languages you will use different languages for the same word, like French where you would say "Student a obtenu une note de" instead of "Student has a". But here in English, you should use "a" in every case, so the printf statement should be "printf("Student has a" */
