/* The buggy function was failing because it was checking for strictly less than or greater than, which did not cover all cases
   For example if a=1, b=2 and c=3, then it would print out b is the median, even though b is in the middle of the numbers.

   The correct function now checks for less than or equal to and greater than or equal to, which covers all cases.

/* The given code is checking for the median of the three numbers entered by the user.
It had a mistake in the logic used for checking the median. It should be "<=" instead of "<".
This is because, for a number to be a median, it should be greater than or equal to both of its neighbours and less than or equal to both of its neighbours.
This fix corrects the bug in the logic and provides the correct solution. */

/* This function is supposed to take in three numbers, and print the median.
   The original code has a bug where it only checked if B was less than the other two numbers.
   This would not correctly identify B as the median if B was the largest or smallest of the three numbers,
   so the correct code checks if B is in between A and C, A and B, or B and C. */
