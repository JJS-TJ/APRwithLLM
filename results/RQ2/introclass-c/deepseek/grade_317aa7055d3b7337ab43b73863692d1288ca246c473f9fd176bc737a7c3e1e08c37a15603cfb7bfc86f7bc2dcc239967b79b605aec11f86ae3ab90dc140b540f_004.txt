/* The error in the code was that the logic to calculate the grade is wrong. The logic for checking if the student has failed the course was also wrong. 

Instead of checking if the score is 0 and less than A, B, C, D, we need to check if the score is less than D. This way, if the score is less than D, the student has failed the course. 

Also, the logic for calculating the grade was incorrect. If the score was less than A, it was assigned the grade 'A', which is incorrect. The correct logic is to assign the grade based on the range of scores that each grade letter represents. */

/* 
The original code was incorrect in the initial if statement:
  if (percent == 0 && percent < A && percent < B && percent < C && percent < D)
  
This was corrected to:
  if (percent < D && percent > 0)

This was also a correcting factor because the percent can not be less than D, greater than 0, and equal to 0 at the same time, so the first if statement was inaccurate.
