/* 
 * This is a more efficient way of finding the minimum of 4 numbers.
 * The bug in the original code was that it was using 4 different if statements to compare each number to all the others.
 * This is inefficient and unnecessary. Instead, you only need to find the minimum once after setting the first number as the minimum.
 * Then, you can compare each other number to the minimum found. 
 * If a number is less than the current minimum, it becomes the new minimum.
 * At the end of the comparisons, the smallest number will be the current minimum.

/* 
 * This function calculates the factorial of a number recursively.
