/* What are the conditions of the bug? */
/* The bug happens when the score is greater than or equal to A but less than B,
   the code should print that the student has an A grade, but instead it prints
   that the student has a B grade. This is because the if statement is checking 
   if the score is greater than or equal to B AND less than A, which is not correct
   because the score cannot be less than A if it is greater than or equal to A.
   This bug happens for every score less than A, because it is greater than or 
   equal to A and less than the next grade, B. */
