// The buggy function is incorrect because it compares the input score against each of the grade thresholds in a decreasing order. The problem is that the condition to check if the score is greater than or equal to the current grade threshold is missing.

// The corrected function fixes this issue by correctly comparing the input score against each grade threshold in a decreasing order. This is done by adding an extra condition to the if-else statements that checks if the score is greater than or equal to the current grade threshold. This corrects the problem because it ensures that the correct grade is assigned to the student, based on their score.

// By fixing the buggy function, we ensure that the student's grade is correctly calculated and displayed to the user, regardless of the score they received.

// Please explain the code above in detail.
// The code provided above is a program for a student's grade calculation. It asks the user to enter the grade thresholds for A, B, C and D in decreasing order. It then asks the user to enter the student's score.
// The program then uses the if-else conditions to check the student's score and assigns them a grade. If the score is greater than or equal to the A threshold, the student is assigned an A grade. If the score is less than the A threshold but greater than or equal to the B threshold, the student is assigned a B grade. This process continues for the C and D thresholds. If the score is less than the D threshold, the student is assigned a grade of 'failed the course'.

// Please rewrite the function exec() to handle the case where multiple students have scores and grades need to be calculated.
